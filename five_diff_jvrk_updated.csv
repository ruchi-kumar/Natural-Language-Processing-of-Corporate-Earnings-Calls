One is the oilfield business continued to decline on both a volume and a margin basis, and that's the biggest -- one of the -- I'd say one of the 2 biggest drivers was, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the oilfield, although we are seeing it flatten out. The other one was the base epoxy, and that also is driven by turnarounds that occur in one quarter versus another quarter. So that was a significant driver there. In terms of other businesses, really, those 2 would be the major drivers on both a volume and a margin compression basis on a quarter-over-quarter.",-2,3,-3

But at least that's the way we see it. There are a couple of factors that tend to convince us that this is not a repeat of 2008, 2009 in the demand patterns we're seeing. The first thing is in 2008 and 2009, we saw very significant weakness in a few market segments and this time, when we look at all the product segments and all the market segments that we serve, we saw them all go down at about the same rate, which to us seems to indicate it's more -- at least for us in Q3, it's more about supply than demand. The other fact that our distributors point out to us in our recent conversation is that they haven't seen a lot of significant cancellations or backlog adjustments, which indicates to them mostly what we're seeing is an orderly reduction of inventory rather than the severe dislocations that we all experienced in 2008 and 2009. So at Analog, unlike many other companies in the industry, we had a very significant run up in Q2, well above our seasonal rates. When we grow 9% sequentially in the quarter, that typically, we'd grow 4% to 5%. That sort of rates that there was an inventory built in the channel and most of what we saw last quarter from both the distributors statistics and also the commentaries from our largest customers, the great thing to believe, it's much more about -- at least in Q3, much more about supply than demand. It's also interesting in Analog what Dave mentioned when we reported our distribution sales, which were half of our sales were sellout. So last quarter, the distributor's built quite a bit of inventory, which shows up as revenues for many companies, but not revenues for Analog Devices. 
So while we would all that up, and we listened to the comments from the large customers, the comments from our distributors, at least in Q3, I believe we will come to believe that it was mostly about supply gyrations, not demand. I think as far as what happens in the future, we really don't know. You could read this report or that, you can read a summary or that, I mean this editorial of New York Times or another one of The Wall Street Journal, and there's a bunch of opinions out there of what's going to happen. And we can't predict that, which is why the range of possibilities for Q4, at least as we see it, is very large. 
In the short term, as, I think, Dave indicated and I made some comments on, we're really being careful on discretionary expenses. We have a natural hedge on our expense growth with the variable comp plan, which when -- last year's results were coming in, was paying at an extremely high rates and has now cycle down pretty hard, and will continue to as results are getting better. We're reallocating resources to the projects and the segments, and the customers that are the most strategically relevant  for us. We have very low and variable manufacturing cost structure. So I think we're in pretty good shape to react to anything the world throws at us, although I would repeat, we really just don't know what the world is going to throw at us next quarter. But I think we have a very resilient business model now, much more resilient than it was 2 or 3 years ago, much more of our costs of variable and our product portfolio is lot less volatile than what it has been. So again, if the world goes to hell, our results won't be that great, but I think we're well-suited to respond to whatever the world throws at us.",-3,2,-3
