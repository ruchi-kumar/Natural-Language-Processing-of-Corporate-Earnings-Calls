I mean, there's a lot of elements, some of which will not only start to kick in, in the second half of '17 and some which we have expectations for '18 and beyond. But let me be clear on that. We think the cumulative effort that we've taken makes -- will make 2016 the bottom for that business. Some of this is long term, but some of it is actually very near term. Look, I think the truth is, for that business, the first half of '16 was the strongest part in terms of sales because I think, if you remember, part of what we've been doing in this business is running off some very big jobs and then having to sell a lot of singles and doubles to make up for some very big jobs. And we still had one of the very big jobs running in the first half of '16. So when you look on the first 2 quarters of this year, you're going to see us up on the revenue side against that and you might be saying, ""Look, Steve -- where is all the stuff that Steve is saying is already starting to make progress?"" But if you normalize a bit for that, you'll be able to see that we are out there hustling and having some success, even on the revenue side. And the cost side is there. So I have a lot of confidence that we have -- we -- this business historically was a great business. I mean, if you talk to the leaders of that business, they'll be quite frank about the fact that they were slow to reexamine their strategy. But we've retained really strong talent. And people in that group are incredibly enthusiastic about the direction we're heading going forward and feel that we're really making progress. So I'm -- I have a lot of confidence that 2016 was the bottom for that business. Does that help?",2,-2,-2
108,1279818,71498485,1828509,291981,"NIKE, Inc.","Yes. The way I would think about FX in fiscal year '20 is we came into the year expecting FX to be sort of neutral to slightly favorable. It's now a net negative from an EBIT perspective. Again, that's in the context of our slightly improved guidance. So we are thrilled that our operational performance just continues to be so strong that it's offsetting that.
Over the balance of the year, one thing to keep in mind is it's somewhat difficult to predict -- not to predict, but to model the impact of FX. You have very volatile actual spot rates. Certainly the renminbi is at the top of the list in that regard of late. The timing of our hedges over the course of the year as well as the timing, which is a kind of backward looking timing aspect in terms of when we lock in product cost. 
So I think that the easiest way for me to say it is FX will be about 3 points negative headwind on revenue as I spoke about in my guidance, it'll be a slightly negative impact on margin over the course of the full fiscal year, and it's now shifted to a slightly negative impact from an EBIT perspective. 
But we're hopeful that those are more transient impacts. And that as we go forward and we get more certainty with respect to trade and some resolution, that maybe we see things turn from a headwind into a tailwind.",-3,1,1
180,1199215,67608945,1722491,289272,"ALLETE, Inc.","Yes, so you see on the regulatory side, O&M was down approximately $8 million pre-tax and we signaled in our guidance O&M would be down roughly 10%. So think about there about $15 million to $20 million on a year-over-year basis. So you saw the $8 million. And it isn't going to be even. The fourth quarter last year we had higher expenses. I expect a similar variance for the fourth quarter of roughly $8 million or so. Second quarter, I think would be roughly $2 million down or so. Third quarter, I'd expect it to be flat, of course, all dependent on when we -- actual results will differ from budget. But that's our expectations right now.",-3,1,-1
181,741275,48272427,1172979,247483,Abbott Laboratories,"Well, I may have to phone a friend for that last part, but let me address the first part. You'll recall -- well, first of all, we set our target for the year at healthy double digits. Now we've got St. Jude in the mix there, so there's extra healthy double digits. But even on top of just last year on a comparable basis, there's a double-digit earnings growth target here, which, again, I would point out, is not typical across our peer group or competitors, et cetera, or even the companies that our investors compare us to, many of which are not health care. And so we start the year with healthy double-digit target and guidance, and then the gating of that guidance over the quarters. As you may recall in the first quarter, the issue was, gee, it looks back-end loaded. And our fourth quarter is always strong, and our first quarter is always the low quarter of the year. And so when you look at that and you say, okay, the investor tends to think that last quarter, gosh, that looks like such a big hill. So we have a strong first quarter, that tends to be the case. We tend to have lower guidance then, and we tend to beat it each year. It tends to be a pattern. And then there's -- I look at each year a little superstitiously. I guess if you've been around long enough, you get to see this. But every year, exchange or something happens later in the year, where there's a change, there's a political change, there's an exchange adjustment of some kind or whatever. So I'm reluctant to adjust guidance in the first quarter for almost anything and -- because I'd like to see the year play out a little more first because I don't like to whip around the shareholders, particularly when we're already looking at a double-digit growth target, which is annual for us. And so I look at it and say, okay, we're off to a nice strong start. We have had a bit of favorable exchange. We do know there's some timing in there, and there's also some strength in there. And I'd like to see that strength sustained, and I'd like to see the exchange sustained. I'd like to see more than 3 months play out here. So in the meantime, my view would be, let's take some of the gating off the back part of the year. Let's re-gate this a little bit more gently, call it a little smoother, and let's wait to see another card played in the second quarter. I just don't think it's prudent at this early point in the year to make adjustments to earnings that are already double-digit targets until we see more cards played. I mean, that's basically my thought process, Rick. I mean, you can second-guess me all you want, but that's how I thought about it. Scott's going to -- or Brian is going to help you with your second question on the quarter.",3,-1,3
322,1505690,84672668,2154717,274818,SPX Corporation,"Yes. I'll take a pass at that as well. So Engineering Solutions has done extraordinarily well this year. It's been one of our really strong points, a resilient part of our business during the pandemic. We ended the year with a good book of business. We'll enter next year with a good book of business. If you go back to Q4 of last year, a lot of the -- some of the pricing activities that we saw flow through the first 3 quarters began last year in the fourth quarter. Some of the operational and some of the mix improvements that we made, we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. So the comp of last year included a lot of the operational and pricing improvements that we have benefited from in the first 3 quarters of this year. 
As we look into next year, we do see a modest organic decline. We see maybe a modest margin decline. But that being said, we still think we have a lot of opportunities for that to be a solid contributor. And as Gene said, this is one of the opportunities, I think, that for continuous improvement, there's a lot of dollars there that the Lean process, 80/20 process will be very well-suited to help us gain some margin improvement there as well.",-2,2,-2
353,248515,17708240,370484,262639,Commercial Metals Company,"Yes. The greatest impact of -- in Poland was, I think we shared with you in the second quarter, we saw a sudden, I'll call it a deluge of imports into Poland, which really complicated matters and volumes, and prices declined really dramatically. Third quarter, those prices began to recover and some of the volume as well. And the fourth quarter is just a kind of a continuation of that. We also did take a write-down of a fab business of about $3 million, which also impacted the quarterly results, making it look a little bit worse than it was. But we've seen some improvement, both in volume as well as in pricing. We expect the Polish market to remain difficult, however. We're going into the winter time when things are less -- are more volatile and there's less activity. And margins do get squeezed, so that's typical. And we're working on our mix of merchants versus rebars and still a lot of upside on shipping more merchant. But the same phenomena that we have in the United States of what I'll call a premium for merchants isn't quite as large as it is in -- it's much larger in North America than it is in Europe. And I think that owes to the fact that there's not the same level of consolidation and more aggressive pricing on merchants, vis-Ã -vis rebar in Europe, particularly under the current economic conditions. So we've been squeezed on that end as well.",-3,1,-3
492,1364075,75130629,1911648,281407,International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.,"Yes. That's a fair point because we had -- for some of these, we had double-running costs because when you close down a factory, and basically, the receiving end, you have to ramp up already and to get it into the new one. I think that's important. And that will go away because we have closed down 10 factories last year. We will do another dozen probably until October of this year. So these double-running costs, at least for the 10 we have closed, it's gone. I think that's good. And then we had a couple of smaller divestitures versus previous year as well, and that's impacting it.",-3,1,-3
496,569414,40102633,941708,1040657,Metaldyne Performance Group Inc.,"Sure. I think in kind of general buckets, as we've talked about transitioning out of our KBI noncore wheel bearings and as we mentioned during that conference, the margin profile of KBI was similar to our kind of machine and value-added content. And so as that, call it, roughly 3% of our business transitions out, there's certainly a volume impact. But again, it's a noncore part of our product. That will partially offset because if you just do the math, that would be a higher number than what you're seeing. The delta between the 2 is you've got a couple of other headwinds in terms of industrial markets. We saw that was a half year last year. We'll see a full year impact this year. And then, we also mentioned the Class 8 vehicles. But more than offsetting that is the cost reduction activities. We continue to do that. As George mentioned, we have an endless stream, is probably the right word. We continue to find various ways to improve our efficiencies and reduce costs in our businesses. And then, our powertrain growth continues to grow and our content. And that, again, tends to be in the, I'll say, machine and assembled, which tends to have a higher margin profile than maybe some of our first form parts.",2,-2,-1
518,233131,16728952,345446,139813,PG&E Corporation,"Well, let me just reiterate. Weâre committed to the dividend. We believe thatâs an important part of the value proposition for a company like ours. But in terms of policy, we canât revisit what weâre going to do until we get some major things behind us, like the gas proceedings, weâve got cost of capital, weâve got to take a look at some indication of where the general rate case is going to be going before we would be able to say any more about policy going forward. So, what weâve been saying is weâre committed to the dividend, but weâre going to have to resolve a couple of these major issues before we start to give you some guidance on what you might expect.",-3,1,-3
658,224956,16457439,339846,666631,Allegiant Travel Company,"Sure. First of all, let me go back to the last question. Let me add one more thing about the monthly RASM performance we forecast. I think that the capacity growth that we showed throughout the quarter also mirrors the results we expect. So the growth in August is greater than July, the growth in September is greater than August. And part of that is just due to the really tight capacity that we had last year during that same period, and we feel really good about the capacity plan for the quarter, I might add. So anyway, as far as your other question. Yes, I think that there is just -- we fought this issue when we went public about this really factually incorrect and empirically proved to be incorrect notion that somehow in a recessionary environment, leisure is where you don't want to be. We think the facts are clear and they stayed exactly the opposite. And so we're just trying to, I guess, take the opportunity to remind investors that, I mean, I guess, maybe the next time around, it may be different. But we see no reason to believe that it would be. We performed extremely well during the downturn environment and if we do end up seeing one, then I think we expect that the history will repeat itself. That being said, no, we don't see any trends that are alarming in any way. When we try to strip out the capacity adjustments we have in August and September, which are pretty substantial on a year-over-year basis. And then we try to see, okay, are we doing what you would expect on a seasonal basis. Obviously, back half of August, September are 2 of the weaker -- or it's one of the weaker periods during the year. And as we look at that, what we see is maybe something that's slightly below normal seasonal patterns but ever so slight and we don't see any real -- we don't see any change in the trend line or anything like that, John, but obviously, we're keeping our eye on the macro environment. And at this point, I think that -- maybe the best way to put it is our capacity plans remain intact nd at this point, we're not looking in any way of changing that. And of course if we see a reason to do so, we will. But at this point in time, we're very comfortable with what we have on the books in terms of our capacity in the back half of the year.",-2,2,-1
712,1343293,74415440,1897943,252339,Ashland Global Holdings Inc.,"Yes. I think we're -- this is sort of our seasonal low if you look at it in this normal type of the year, but we are seeing already indications. If you look at, as I said, pharma had a tough comp, but there was a lot of actions in Q1 from customers around inventory, things that they did, and we're starting to see the pickup of that. We saw a few in personal care, a few customers delay orders just because as an example, in the sun care area, it was a softer year for our customers last year, so there was some inventory impact, but we're seeing those orders already coming in now. And for coatings, I think the indication is more -- for us, seasonally, it's more the back half of the year. And indications is that that'll start picking up. Architectural coatings are the big driver for us, and that's more of a seasonal driver.",2,-2,1
729,1395513,78761430,2013008,175749,Equifax Inc.,"And those, John, are happening as we speak, meaning, just with the massive spike in unemployment claims coming in, Manav, we're certainly in revenue mode with those subscription agreements that we have.",-3,1,-2
