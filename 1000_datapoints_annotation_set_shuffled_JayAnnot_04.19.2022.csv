Whether it'd be those bonds, whether it'd be the stock, whether it'd be investments in new properties. In terms of acquisitions, we may -- it's early, ask again later as the Magic 8 ball would say, but I think in the next 3 or 4 months, we will likely see some tremendous distressed opportunities. And to the extent that you can do those and they help your balance sheet and the overall corporate returns, then we'll consider everything. But we are economic creatures. We are numbers driven. We're not going to go and buy a bunch of properties, betting that oil prices go up tomorrow, because we don't know any better than the next guy.

It seems like it's a biweekly process or something now as they're looking at things, which suggests that when they do decide to turn things back up, they'll be able to turn them back up relatively quickly.

I can tell you that, that wasn't unexpected. We made some schedule changes last year so we've got some difficult comps to the first and second quarters. We moved some programming more limited on our schedule that wasn't attracting the upscale audience that we want. So what's happening is, while the ratings have declined a bit, and a bit more than we expected in the first quarter to be honest, the audience composition has gotten better. And in fact, the median income has improved every quarter sequentially since we started making these moves. So just like I said before, Food Network, we have a lot of new programming coming on between now and the end of the year, the same is true with Travel Channel.

761096,48869751,1188741,368607,Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.,"Jonathan, the Chilean business this year compared to 2015/'16 season is completely different. 2015/'16 season was good in 1 -- in 2 different ways. First, the quality of the fruit was excellent in that season, '15/'16. Secondly, the inventory of California was on the low side so -- and the fruit volume in Chile was shorter in general. So it was like a perfect scenario. Excellent quality, short volume and low inventory in California. And '16/'17 was the opposite completely. Bad quality because of rain and very bad weather conditions during the growing season in Chile. The inventory in California was record high and the quality was -- I mean, the volume was much higher than the previous year. So it was bad on all sides. The quality was bad. The volume was over the market needs and a lot of inventory in California. And that, in my opinion, is the case. I don't believe never -- we can never tell. But next season, which starts in December this year, could be a completely different scenario. However, in our case, we try to mitigate this by quality problems should go back to the grower pockets and not our pocket. So this is a business that every few years, you will get a hiccup, and we need to adjust as well because the red grapes usually -- now are not becoming a very favorable start -- I mean, to start the season, you have to start with more white grapes rather than red grapes because of the Californian inventories. So it's like a scenario where we have to live with every few years.",-1

So certainly, over the last 5 years, free cash flow exceeded more than 100% of our net income number. If I look at 2019 and 2020 and I start with the 2019 number of approximately $1.6 billion for free cash flow, that looks like a 9% growth rate to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, which is $1.75 billion. 
However, there are 2 adjustments that are definitely worth considering to make it more of a comparable apples-to-apples viewpoint. And those relate to capital additions, which were relatively light in 2019 at $69 million vis-à-vis sort of the normal 100-ish run rate which we're expecting in 2020. 
And the second impact relates to incentive compensation. Now just a quick reminder here. 2018 incentive compensation is paid usually in the first quarter of the following year, so in this case, first quarter of 2019. And that amount was $169 million. For 2019, the incentive compensation is paid in the first quarter of 2020, and that amount is $237 million. So if you adjust for both capital additions and incentive compensation, the underlying growth rate in free cash flow is around 15%, which is higher than the adjusted EPS growth rate of 11% at the midpoint, and that's something we as a management team feel very comfortable with.",3

Our second priority is to really invest in the business through mergers and acquisitions. We announced the Angelo Costa deal about a month ago that will be a good use of our international cash. All the time we're looking at other things out there so we want to look to acquire companies but that kind of go well with our strategy and have the right cash-on-cash economic return. And then from there, really returning cash to our shareholders. As we announced today, another $1 billion of stock buybacks. We've got about $1.4 billion through the end of 2012. Back in December, we moved to a more balanced payout on our dividend. Our Board increased that by 17%, and so as we look forward, we'll prioritize our cash that way. Probably one important thing to remind everyone too is that about half of our cash flows are U.S. About half of our cash flows are international, so we'll prioritize those as we need to move forward. But we're in the fortunate position of generating $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of cash. Then they really allow us to drive and execute our strategies and return the capital to shareholders.",3

So as I mentioned, it's going to take us, well, I'd say, kind of a quarter and a half or so to make sure that fundamentally, that all of the engine kind of works properly. It's a good deal more complicated process to have the bank license our technologies and host those technologies and use those technologies. So it's -- we spent a lot of time, a lot of energy on it. It's been a very big -- as the developers like to say, a heavy lift from an IT standpoint. We just want to make sure all that works well. And as we get through the year, I think we'd like to -- our view is we'd like to exit the year with somewhere in the range of $50 million to $75 million of earning assets in that program. And that those are installment -- closed-end installment loans and probably be in -- we're in 2 states now and you probably -- as you're growing that business, maybe you exit the year and you're in 5 or 6 states by the time you exit the year. We've -- Stride is a really interesting, innovative, really entrepreneurial bank. We've done stuff with them on the payment side in the past. So it's a relationship we've had for a while. So we've known each other from a team standpoint for a long time. So I think from a -- I think probably, as I don't see it's sort of expanding outside of this closed-end installment product. As we look into probably -- I think that will probably, I would say, it would probably stick to the same kind of products all the way through 2021. Longer-term, it's kind of hard to speculate on what else we might be working on together because there's a lot of opportunity in some states that we don't operate in right now online to offer a really competitive installment product. So again, end the year 5 or 6 states, $50 million to $75 million of earning assets and have that kind of roll into really healthy business and a good earnings contribution in 2021.",3

325431,21279412,454555,867423,Lincoln National Corporation,"That's a great question. We give it a lot of thought around here. What I look at the Lincoln fact situation, we've increased pricing pretty significantly either through reducing the benefit levels or from actually increasing the charge on our riders. Collectively, we've done that over the last couple of years. We've -- sort of separate from the consumer, we've decreased commissions, we've also recently restricted add-on payments. So there's quite a bit that we've done. And I think, as you've pointed out, others have done the same thing, yet we continue to see good demand from consumers. So I don't think we've yet reached the point where the price changes the industry has been making is at a the point where consumers don't think VA is still a good product for them for part of their portfolio. How much further we can do, we can go, I think we'll just have to see. It's a combination of not just VA, but what other alternative investment opportunities are available to consumer. But so far so good. And again, at Lincoln, we're producing 20% ROEs on a consistent basis. You heard Randy talk about the hedge fund performance, and Standard & Poor's and Moody's both publicly say that Lincoln's hedge performance -- excuse me, hedge strategy and risk management is singularly the best in the industry. So we'll make adjustments as we can. It's good business and, in the right amount, we're quite happy with it.",3
400102,26491907,582944,93578,"CNO Financial Group, Inc.","Yes. I mean, it's a good question. I'll give you my perspective on it, Randy, and that is that the bond markets have a nice ability to, within reason, pierce through the actual ratings of the company to assess the credit strength of the underlying property. We actually saw that in the last recapitalization and even refinancing we did, where, clearly, I think, the pricing we received and even, to some degree, the flexibility in terms were arguably a good notch above what we are actually reported at because you see some of the bond market and the lending market react to our favorable progress. As a result, we -- it's not just a matter of when we receive investment grade because we will eventually, that we're going to ring some big bell and go to market. We're going to watch things very carefully along the way. I'm after some very simple things, and I mentioned them in my comments. One, I want to see that I have a material benefit to my cost of capital because I know there's a cost associated with recapping the company. And I want that cost recovered quickly, and I want it to lower my permanent cost of capital. So I want to watch that. The second thing is we really would benefit, as a company, for -- from greater flexibility in the structure. Things like sweeps and baskets, which actually do come into play when we're looking at opportunistically deploying capital, are things that we need to adhere to that we're not real fond of. We also have awful lot of just structure. We have -- we are in no risk of breaching covenants. We have substantial room and cushion, as you can imagine, between covenant structures. But just having a lengthy set of covenants is not a good position to be in, it's even an optically bad position to be in because it actually causes, in a circular way, the rating agencies to look at your financial flexibility as being somehow less flexible. And so with that, I'd also like to string out maturities at some degree. It's not just a matter of the fact that we have to amortize our debt, we also have some limits as to how far out we can go with our debt. So I'm constantly having to stare a few years out to a fairly large maturity, and I think you'd be very careful about that. So those are the things I'm after. If I can get those types of structural things before I reach the promised land of investment grade, then we'll do what you would expect us to do. We'll go out to market and make it happen. But right now, that's not quite the case. We still have a bit more work to do, but we'll keep watching the markets carefully.",-1

Clearly those are, despite their nature, nonrecurring. We talked about supply chain deleveraging. We've seem to have gotten a better handle on that at least on the Retail side. We're still -- got significant fuel cost increases running through the P&L and in the back half, that should be on the order of about 50%. So supply chain is a continuous process of making sure that we can leverage. And then in the first quarter, we had some headwinds there. And then we talked about the promotional environment and what the promotional environment drove, including weather that forced us to make some moves in the technology category. So just refreshing on what happened in Q1 last year, I'm sorry, Q1 earlier this year and then compare that to what happened this year, this year in the second quarter, our promotional environment didn't have the same elements that we saw in the first quarter. Supply chain, in this case, was not nearly the headwind that it was in the first quarter and of course, we didn't have the transitory items.

So they picked up a significant amount of income off of the changes that they're making with their operating team and their structure, and it's really come into the bottom line, so.

I think we've tested like 3 different intervals within that 400- or 500-foot section, and we've continued to test the Woodford across that acreage position as well as down in the SCOOP, where we've moved out of the wet gas condensate window up into the oil window. So we're very excited about the results that we're seeing. Specific to STACK, we continue to see competitive results between the Meramec and the Woodford and it's not something that we've done at this point to go ahead and segregate. I think that we tested 3 horizons, they all work. We tested the Woodford in multiple locations, it's all working. I think we told you guys originally that we thought there would be 3 to 5 horizons to exploit, and I would say, we're well on our course. And the results we're delivering are in accordance with our plan.",3

It's not just the big buckets of labor and marketing, but all the other areas, utilities and cost of goods et cetera.

In terms of where -- what we need to see in terms of an IRR from a project versus buying back capital, if you recall, I said to Sam that we have a matrix of things that we look at. So one of those things is obviously just outright return, but the other one is the risk. And clearly, something that's got a 0 risk to us, such as buying back debt for instance at face value doesn't need to have a very high return to come out in front on a risk-adjusted basis. So that's why we bought the debt back in Q1 -- Q3, sorry. I think we would need to see -- again, there is no single metric we look at. The metric that we give the most weighting to is NPV-to-CapEx ratio on an after-tax basis at 8%. We really need to see that metric at least better than 0.25:1 and ideally better than 0.5:1. So you can back calculate from there what that needs to be. But projects have got to give us -- given that there's always risk in projects developing them, a project has to give us a pretty decent return for us to justify spending the money on it.",-1

On the first part, Nik, I've been saying for the better part of 5 years now that one way you can think about what we do around here is, we're perpetually reshaping our portfolio for better growth and better margins. And underneath that, we do it 3 ways: one, we invest in innovation to strengthen the brands we own; two, we acquire new brands where our playbook can easily be applied that will be additive and complementary and incremental to what we already do; and three, we will divest stuff that either doesn't fit strategically or is a chronic drag on our margin or our sales rate or it's just too resource-intensive for us to consider to be a priority. 
We've been very aggressive in doing all 3 of these things for the last 5 years. And on that third piece, with -- in terms of divestitures that help us better sculpt growth and margins, we remain very active there, including just the new news today that we intend to sell Lender's. So there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of activity there, and I don't expect that to change. Obviously, the inbound stuff is going to change because we're in the mode of deleveraging right now and that will be the case for some time. But the divestiture side, we've been active in, and we'll continue to look at our portfolio. In terms of trade efficiency and customer investment, it -- this is a space that was very Neanderthal 20 years ago and not very analytical to a space that has become much more analytical and much easier to evaluate particular activities in terms of ROI. And to enable some of that, we've made investments in technology so we can really get at the data and leverage the analytical tools that are available to us now and that is resulting in better bang for our buck. And it actually is applied not only to trade, but we also apply the similar types of advanced analytics to our A&P investments. And the whole goal of this is to identify the proverbial 50% of your marketing that people always talked about doesn't work so we can cut it and redeploy it elsewhere to be more productive for us. And we've made strong and steady progress in terms of that efficiency and effectiveness in the last several years and it continues even as we go through this year.",1

So that's -- the side-by-side model is much more profitable than stand-alone stores. And so we're seeing good performance with OshKosh, seeing good comps.

And so as you look at the comments we made about the U.S. advertising spend and then take Brookside, which is incremental, and then think about what we're doing broadly, it all doesn't come down to being spent on Brookside.

I mean, there's a lot of elements, some of which will not only start to kick in, in the second half of '17 and some which we have expectations for '18 and beyond. But let me be clear on that. We think the cumulative effort that we've taken makes -- will make 2016 the bottom for that business. Some of this is long term, but some of it is actually very near term. Look, I think the truth is, for that business, the first half of '16 was the strongest part in terms of sales because I think, if you remember, part of what we've been doing in this business is running off some very big jobs and then having to sell a lot of singles and doubles to make up for some very big jobs. And we still had one of the very big jobs running in the first half of '16.

Look, we’re obviously extremely disappointed in how it unfolded and what we try to do on our earnings calls is to obviously communicate where we are in leasing at a particular point in time, but like we heard a couple of questions earlier, everybody wants to also know “Well, where are you going to end up?” And we gave our best estimate of that and we were wrong.
Just a little bit of historical perspective: We were 220 basis points behind in July in the same communities from the prior year, and when we were looking at the data and I went back and refreshed my memory, last year in 2011 from that same late July date, we added 8.6 percentage points of new leases to arrive at our ending of the year 94.7% same-community occupancy. Well, unfortunately this year, we only added 6.6 percentage points and so therefore there’s the 200 basis points decline.
Last year from July forward we actually improved our variance to the prior year by 120 basis points. Obviously this year we went behind 200 basis points. So in late July we gave the information that we thought was appropriate based upon all the systems that we have and all of the judgments that we made. Obviously, what we should have said is, “We have plans in place to recoup the occupancy, but we’re unwilling to give you a guess going forward,” where last time we actually said we’d thought we’d make up the ground or half the ground.
We’re trying to give the best outlook that we possibly can, or the best information for the outlook that we possibly can. I guess our past 2 years of successful history got us overconfident and we shouldn’t have been quite as cavalier that we were going to make up the ground.",-3

So in particular, a couple of things we're seeing and we didn't talk about this earlier, but our rejection levels are down significantly from the previous quarter. So we're starting to see rejection come down. A lot of that was driven by economics in the frac spread. We talked about the low gas. So NGL volumes are up, obviously, we push a lot of NGL out of the Permian area and Wouter alluded to the gas constraints as well until Gulf Coast Express comes back online, we're seeing those constraints. So those will kind of materialize and lower gas prices. Again not to beat the dead horse, but Guadalupe is a wonderful offset to those lower prices, but we are seeing potentially some limitations as we are rejecting less more NGL volumes on the pipelines, that sort of bottleneck is happening in the fractionator side of the equation. Our team has done a phenomenal job of managing that thus far. And of course, as you know, there's some fractionators coming online.
But the watch out is that could result in lower netbacks for the company. I'll give you one key example, even though we're not, we're still moving those volumes, those NGL volumes, we're moving more of them to Conway, than we would to Bellevue. It shows the diversity of our portfolio. But those do give us lower netbacks. And we think, we'll see more of that in Q2. Not a huge number.

We think the underlying market dynamics are -- and fundamentals over the long term are really strong. The underlying secular demand drivers, our unique competitive position and our strategy would, over time, under more normal market condition scenario, continue to support a mid-single-digit kind of long-range target. And that's exactly what we were talking about -- at your conference is our belief and our confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the market on a long-term basis. 
And clearly, the difference between that and our immediate near-term outlook is simply a function of some of the challenges that we faced in the markets where we're particularly exposed. And to be -- to not assume that those change overnight that, as I mentioned before, that the starting point is more of a carryover from the conditions that we saw. And so in terms of what it would take to get back up into the mid-single-digit plus, it's really a normalization in demand in a couple of key market segments, notably, the small molecule pharma segment, certainly, general conditions within China returning to reasonable growth and a stabilization of the industrial markets. 
We don't have to get huge growth out of the industrial markets. We have to get modest growth out of the industrial markets and then more of a historic norm in terms of the pharma business. As I mentioned before, the large molecule pharma space has continued to stay robust for the market and for Waters through this whole period, and so it's really about that small molecule space perking up. And certainly, with some of the deferred investment in that space, we do see pent-up demand building, but until we see it come back into the market, we'll continue to remain cautious.
As it relates to pricing, there's nothing unusual in terms of pricing in our assumptions. We have seen quite stable pricing on the instrument side. We continue to put small increases through on the recurring revenue side.

A lot of our business, like Aviation, are dollar based. And then obviously, in Oil & Gas and in a number -- Energy Management and a number of our other business, we do work in local currency. And so Brazil -- where we're in Brazil and Europe, in the euro, we've had a little bit of a currency impact, and that's what you hear us reporting when we give you reported versus organic. On the orders front, I don't think we've seen that big an impact.

So on average, for the quarter, is about $12 million a day, which was impacted on the Versado system. So we would not expect that impact in Q3. Our longer-term outlook for that area, whether it's the Versado, or even just anywhere in the Delaware, is kind of up and to the right. We said, for the acquisition, kind of very high single digits.

1477838,82439800,2097596,579312452,Vertiv Holdings Co.,"Yes. Thanks, Lance. This is David. And first, I'll lead off. We always like the midpoint of our guidance. We likely will provide ranges, but we're generally comfortable at the midpoint. And I can help you with the $150 million adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint and how that walks from the $145 million from the second quarter. So being a finance guy, we try to get things as quantitative as possible. So we have about $100 million increase in sales from Q2 to Q3. And if you throw a 40% to 45% contribution margin against that, you get about $40 million, $45 million of benefit. And the headwind is certainly going to be on the fixed cost side as we talked about on -- in the prepared remarks. And that could be in that $35 million plus range. And $20 million of that is going to be related to lower benefits from the COVID actions. And these are things that we benefited from in Q2 that we won't benefit in -- from -- in Q3, including furloughs and in certain geographies, we were able to receive some government subsidies. So that's a good portion of the higher fixed costs. 
The other component is our commitment to continue to invest in strategic initiatives. And this is something that we talked about on the last couple of calls. Heading into this year, our plan was to continue to invest in R&D. As we continue to increase that spend as a percentage of sales, we continue to invest in markets that we believe have higher potential and profitable growth, including the channel. In addition, we have some digital projects that we continue to invest in. So the spending for those strategic initiatives ramp-up in the third quarter. And that explains the remainder of the fixed costs increase sequentially from Q2 to Q3.",-2

And I mean, for us, looking at the category, it seems like at any given time, it's always extremely competitive and the deal opportunities, they kind of ebb and flow. All of a sudden, everybody jumps on a 4 for 5 or something like that and the fact that, that's mostly in meal replacement areas and categories in QSR, we're not really seeing a cause and effect, is that affecting what consumers are doing overall with -- in their spend, we're not necessarily seeing that. And then you put the fact that we're -- we've been making adjustments ourselves on our discounting. So it's really hard to tease that out. I don't think that it's going to be -- have a significant impact on our strategy going forward, from a pricing standpoint because we think we have a lot of opportunity there and some of the way that we're undoing some of the things that we've had some patterns in the recent past that's more within own customer base, I think, that we need to manage. The other thing I would tell you that's a really near-term situation in our rearview mirror that is a good example of opportunities for us within our brand is like St. Patrick's Day that we just finished up on, and we had a really, really successful St. Patrick's Day and no, I'm not going to give you any numbers on that yet, but the fact is it was a day where we drove a lot of traffic at a full menu price. We had folks coming in based on our offerings and our strategy, and those are the things that we're looking at as we're weaning away from a lot of the free transactions that we began last year, as we're working on weaning away from the proliferation, I can say that, of everyday discounting and couponing, I would leverage our brand equity on -- for events like that, with St. Patrick's Day.

In terms of the 200-basis-point improvement by 2020, we remain committed to that improvement. And as we've said all along, that improvement is driven by the supply network strategy efforts, to the extent that there's additional opportunity based on price, based on volume, based on mix, which can grow on either direction, that can either have an incremental impact or an incremental improvement over the margin over that time or take away a little bit.

It's now a net negative from an EBIT perspective. Again, that's in the context of our slightly improved guidance. So we are thrilled that our operational performance just continues to be so strong that it's offsetting that.
Over the balance of the year, one thing to keep in mind is it's somewhat difficult to predict -- not to predict, but to model the impact of FX. You have very volatile actual spot rates. Certainly the renminbi is at the top of the list in that regard of late. The timing of our hedges over the course of the year as well as the timing, which is a kind of backward looking timing aspect in terms of when we lock in product cost. 
So I think that the easiest way for me to say it is FX will be about 3 points negative headwind on revenue as I spoke about in my guidance, it'll be a slightly negative impact on margin over the course of the full fiscal year, and it's now shifted to a slightly negative impact from an EBIT perspective. 
But we're hopeful that those are more transient impacts. And that as we go forward and we get more certainty with respect to trade and some resolution, that maybe we see things turn from a headwind into a tailwind.",-3

So one of the things I did not mention, go into detail on, was we have been reorganizing the CoStar sales force a bit in order to get ready for selling these premier LoopNet owner-oriented ads, these sort of upper-end ads. And what we've done is we've identified about 65 salespeople across our network who are the more senior folks, and we're assigning the top owner prospects to them. We're pulling them together for a couple of days of training. So far, we haven't really -- we haven't done that. We're just beginning that process. 
It's relatively straightforward. The value proposition is pretty straightforward. And I think that we'll get adoption -- or the sales force, will pick -- these specialist salespeople will pick this up pretty quickly. And we'll really be relying on them to take that forward. I would expect that over time with success there, we'll feel that 65 is not quite the right number and we'll probably want to grow that team a little bit. But I think we'll take one step at a time. A little bit of success of those 65 people would be a lot of success to our bookings numbers. 
The second part that you mentioned there about partnering with our broker clients is exciting. In the past, we have partnered with our broker clients to basically wholesale or resell advertising to their owner clients and allow them to offer discounts and give them some rebates for volume. And we've had some discussions with some of our brokerage clients about allowing them to resell those LoopNet ads to owners. It's a win-win for everybody, the broker, the owner and us. And it is similar to what happens with Apartments.com. 
So often when we're selling an advertisement for an apartment community to Greystar, Greystar is acting on behalf of an owner who -- we don't really know who they are, but they're just authorized to make the purchase, and Greystar through volume gets a better price for their owner. 
So we'd be looking for the same thing to happen in CoStar LoopNet, but it will be something that would be happening next year. But we got really positive feedback from folks like CBRE and some others on that opportunity. 
And it's not unprecedented again, not only the Apartments.com side, but also CoStar Real Estate Manager where a lot of our sales there are -- is white-labeling from folks like JLL and CBRE and some -- and Cushman & Wakefield who basically steer their clients into CoStar Real Estate Manager.",2

Having been in a lot of platform businesses and marketplace businesses, I will say this is a very, very complex business. It's extremely difficult to enter. It takes -- even if you have a tremendous amount of capital, and you may even think you have one or both sides of the marketplace, it's still incredibly hard to match a homeowner with a service provider for the exact need they have utilizing the exact capacity available at a zip code level. And so I think we have seen lots and lots of well-funded startups try to come in. We've seen other folks trying to participate in the space, and they found it incredibly difficult and hard. As a matter of fact, if you just look at -- we're the only company to have had huge scale and profitability. It's just incredibly difficult, the costs of acquisition. It is difficult to get a service provider on the phone. It's hard enough to get them to understand your business. It's even harder. To get them then to sign up and stick with your product is even that much harder. So there's huge costs and investment, and it takes a very skilled workforce to be able to bring in a high-quality service provider. Then you start doing screening and approving, things like that. Now you have less access because you only want the best of the best. And then you start trying to match up at any given time where you have supply or demand constraints and have the ability to go out and acquire homeowners profitably, and it gets even harder. So I'm not saying that no one will come in, but we've had a lot of people dabble, be it small, medium or large. And I think they've all found it to be a very, very difficult space to be successful in, for everything from the economics to the actual structural matching. I mean we've got 20 years of algorithms that do our matching. The things we're learning at scale, the -- our understanding of cannibalization between channels, how to build products like all of our on-demand products, they're incredibly difficult to do if you do not have scale. I think, anyone looking from the outside in and trying to reverse-engineer this business, good luck. It's really hard. There are other businesses you can do that, but this one's pretty tough.",1

I think you are correct that we have $678 million face on the mortgage and the worst case scenario is we give the property back and that’s not out of the question, but if we can reach an agreement with the servicer that gets a better long-term solution for us and them that would take it to a fact of lot of things, first and foremost, can we make money from the basis that we’d invest new capital at, and we will look at that and if we can’t then that would be a different path. So we’re going to be very economic on that and obviously look at that as to whether the service in us do that, we have put in a relatively modest $4 million as agreement in forbearance with the service of the fund to capital that leased that Joe and I mentioned before and that comes out to interest through cash flow before interest is paid.
So we feel that capital is very safe, we’ll get a return on that. So I think it’s going to look at, we’ll look at that as an economic opportunity and we know the property well and we’ll go from there but we don’t know what kind of solution will ultimately come out at this point.",1

And if you look at last year in the third quarter, our RevPAR was $62, and on a year-to-date basis in -- through 9 months, it was less than $50. So you're looking at a quarter where you were full every weekend and a lot of weeknights, so last year we were driving rate. So just on a percentage basis, you're not going to get the juice that we got in the first 2 quarters. That said, I would say, as I look at Reno, I think we came in $1 million light of where I would have thought we would have been in the beginning of the quarter. And I think that where we can improve there is cost structure on mid-weeknights when occupancies are lower and increasing the hurdle for a casino customer to get a room on a weekend, particularly the busiest weekends, when we know we can sell a lot of very high cash rate rooms. That -- those are things that we are still working on. And as we've talked about, Chad, this is all brand-new territory for us, so we're learning some of this as we go along.

So yes, so we did see -- to your point, we did see incremental each quarter in general got better on the bookings side. So I think a couple of things contributed to that. One is we did a lot of work with the Engility acquisition to strengthen our go-to-market position in the key markets that we talked about, in particular the intel market and the space market. So as you would expect, that takes time to get through the pulling together of a go-to-market team, the building of the pipeline and then being able to solidify that. 
So I think the early work was very positive, and we're applying that same approach to the recent acquisition. And again, we're only a little less than 2 weeks in, but we've already gone through -- we're working through the pipeline and ensuring that we've got the right focus. We've worked through the organizational dynamics of ensuring we have the right go-to-market teams. So we try to do as much as humanly possible, right out of the gate, really focused on business development, go-to-market and pipeline development and adjudication.

It's really important to see that we continue to expect a similar growth tailwind from COVID in Q4 as we did in Q3, and we expect our base business to perform similarly or incrementally better. But it is important to keep in mind that we have 3 working days less, and particularly for these consumer-oriented businesses, that's pretty impactful in the calculation.
Now having said that, as you think about the bioprocesses industry today, already, these companies are producing vaccines. So if you think about Operation Warp Speed and where BARDA is involved, not only are the pharmaceutical companies producing clinical trials quantities, they're already ramping up capacities for those vaccines that they see -- vaccines and therapeutics that they see very near to approval and are hopeful for. And of course, this is financed oftentimes through the federal government, and so there's a great deal of aggressiveness there. 
And so that's already happening here at the back end of Q3, and you'll see that also in Q4. And then as approvals start coming in, and we're hopeful that, that happens at the end of the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, then I would expect to see an additional ramp there as well.",3

And we took really the work that we're doing with NASA on a human health performance contract, and combined that with our relationship and understanding of the Army, and put that sort of side of our past experience together in 1 bundle together with, obviously, the technical skill sets, whether that be on the psychological side or the medical side.

So the aerospace, we would say that would be low single digits. So that is a reasonable number. If you look into PMC given our last quarter, I would say that it should continue to be low single digits. Obviously, the marine side is a problem. The order book for the big guys in Korea were 50% of what their expectations were. So marine new-builds will continue to be a challenge, but the protective side should be really solid. If you look at our refinish business, miles driven continue to go up. Gas prices are down. Distracted driving is up. Insurance claims are up. So refinish has done quite well. So I would call that -- historically, that would be a 0 business, but I'd say it's going to be a low single-digit kind of year. And then that leaves architectural, and I think, again, that's going to vary considerably by the region. We were pleased. The U.K., Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia, all had good 3-plus kind of numbers. That was good for us. France actually stabilized. And so we saw a couple of months in the fourth quarter that were marginally up. It's a little too early to tell yet what we expect there, but I would say France, I'm more optimistic now that I've been the last, say, 9 to 15 months. So that's all good. The Eastern European countries are -- they've had a lot of promotional challenges, but I would tell you overall, it should come back around. When you look at the U.S., we've obviously had some good growth in the U.S. except for the dealer market. The dealer market continues to be challenged. Canada, I think, is probably going to stabilize. So I don't expect a lot in there. Mexico, we've had tremendous growth there. We're going to continue to expect to grow 2x GDP. The one negative in Mexico is the fact that government spending has started to slow down with the price of oil dropping. I think Brazil is going to be a challenge. I think China is going to be a challenge. Australia should be good, at least mid -- I would say low to mid-single digits in Australia. So that's a good market for us.

And we aren't yet in a position to quantify any impact on our rail operations. I mean, what I would say is, one of the projects -- we didn't talk about this, but in our outlook for Australia, there's actually one of the mines we've been shipping for, which is taking some downtime and not shipping, it's been a profitable contributor for a while now. Because they're undergoing a feasibility study that would take those volumes up significantly, but we haven't seen where that's going to go. And so it'll go from, the task was on, the task was off temporarily, and then the task could go on substantially going forward, but we'll have to watch that unfold. It's just a different dynamic in the market than what we've seen. And similarly, with respect to Arrium, there's -- I mean, there are -- there's the possibility that there's some mines -- that the new purchaser has some rights to that makes sense for their internal supply chain and the feedstock for their operations that there's some mines that we used to serve that could be reopen. So the dynamics -- we're not ready to quantify or promise any of those things, but we can tell you is that the dynamics in that market have changed completely, and there's projects being evaluated of significant size that we'd be -- many of which would come across our tracks that we own, independent of whether we were a service provider.",-1

We don't have enough technology. So our mission is to put technology across the platform, and all of our customers are very interested in this. And we think that as we continue to show products and bring out new brands and new devices onto the program, not only in traditional watches but also in wearable technology, in both trackers, fashion trackers and also display watches, we're going to get an additional amount of space and a huge amount of interest about this whole wearable technology thing. A lot of the stores we sell to haven't participated in the explosion of spending it on technology. So again, the watch business is about $65 billion. The tech industry spending is trillions. Consumers, especially millennials, overspend on technology by a long shot, so the stores that we sell to look at this as an opportunity for us to get some of that spending in their store, which could change the situation for them dramatically. So they also recognize that the watch business in their store is -- although it's been soft, and that's mostly because of the fashion miss, but they still recognize it as one the most productive departments in the store, one of the most regular-priced businesses, one of the highest gross margin per square foot businesses. It's not as hot or robust as it was, but it's still, in terms of productivity, one of the best businesses in the store. So we have, as you mentioned, seen, as the businesses decline, we have seen some destocking and we think that is going to probably continue through the first quarter or second until we get increase in amounts of wearable technology in the market.

But the main driver to costs there in the second half -- we're in the fourth quarter now, is really some third-party ore that we anticipate hauling from an operation that it's actually quite a ways away from San Bartolomé, but contains some very high grade ore and we anticipate that stream of high-grade third-party ore purchases to help boost production and help bring those unit costs into a level there that will allow us to achieve the full year cost guidance at San Bartolomé. Rochester, yes, probably on the high end of the guidance range, but we're confident that with these new ounces coming off of the new Stage IV pad plus some cost-reduction opportunities, we're not hauling out any waste anymore like we were in the second quarter to get access to some higher-grade gold in the pit. So we feel like our costs at Rochester should be admitted like towards the higher end of the guidance range, but within that range. And then yes, Kensington, I mentioned in my comments, it's going to be a big push in the fourth quarter. There is a good plan in place to accomplish that, it leans heavily on ore coming out of that Raven zone, which is narrower, higher-grade. We've mined in there periodically over several years. We've got a, we think, a pretty good handle on great performance out of that. They will be dropping stokes to allow us to process some very high grade ore out of Raven that will supplement what we mine from Kensington Main to give us that grade kick that will need to achieve that kind of a production quarter. But the plan -- we have faith in the team, we have faith in and that shows us achieving that kind of a quarter and allowing us to clip the low end of that guidance range of 120,000 to 125,000 ounces.",-2

So our largest market share position by far is the Permian Basin and our core customers we work with are, as Elijio said, the major -- super majors or major independents. And we continue to see them increasing their activity levels and their needs for compression as we go into 2020, and we're very closely linked to them in terms of their planning process.
The other 2 core regions for us, where we have over 70% of our horsepower deployed between the Permian, South Texas and the Mid-Con, again, it really depends on the customers that you're linked to. In South Texas and the Eagle Ford, we're linked to a super major, and we know their demands. And again, pretty consistent with what we've seen from prior years from them. I think the SCOOP/STACK, Midland -- or sorry, the SCOOP/STACK Basin is probably, from terms of activity, the lowest of the 3 but that's not been an area where we've been deploying a lot of our high horsepower in the recent year.

So as you think about the volume piece, specifically on Mineral Fiber volume, as Vic mentioned, we had some timing of inventory with our Big Box channel, and we're seeing nice double-digit growth in October already for that timing. And then the third piece is, as you drive that down to the bottom line, we've mentioned that we'll see about $9 million of restructuring cost benefit in the back half. We saw probably about $4 million of that or we did see $4 million of that in Q3, so we're expecting $5 million more to flow through in Q4.

I think we'll see -- continue to see fair amount of volatility in the multifamily space. And so as we're planning for '19, we think volumes are going to be fairly consistent with the volumes we saw in '18, unless there's an unexpected shift in the mix between single and multi.

But if you are tracking deaths, which I know you are, like we are, I mean, the drop is significant. It's, from its peak, I calculated, down close to 75%. What I said in my commentary, Gary, is that severity is up so that if you look at the number of death claims, the average amounts that we're paying, it's up from, one, the beginning of the pandemic fairly significantly and it's up from the second quarter.
I would say we probably had 8 or 9 large losses above $1 million this quarter. When anyone -- excuse me, we probably had more than that. That was just in June. So we probably have had 15 or 20 large losses when you really expect for a month. So you put it all together. And when the younger folks' mortalities increase significantly, working age, they tend to carry larger face amounts, and we're seeing that come through in the dollars.
But as I ultimately try to foreshadow is that, and we've been talking about this consistently, is that the first half of '21 and the second half is going to be dramatically different so that deaths -- daily deaths are continuing to be down, and we do feel a lessening impact of excess mortality in the second half of the year.",2

What I would say is if we felt like we were carrying flat carryover into next year and if we were confident in the demand supporting that or better, then I think that you'd be -- we'd be more willing -- certainly more willing to spend more than the $1.2 billion we're doing this year. How far up we would go in that total range? Hard to say right here and now. $1.7 billion is the max that we've ever spent. $1.6 billion would be a shade under that. The question at the top end of the range is, ""Hey, would you have enough confidence in the environment to spend close to the max that you've ever spent?"" That would be a robust discussion. That said, it's on the table as we sit right here and now. More realistically, I think we're probably looking something more like what we spent last year, that $1.5 billion kind of number.

741275,48272427,1172979,247483,Abbott Laboratories,"Well, I may have to phone a friend for that last part, but let me address the first part. You'll recall -- well, first of all, we set our target for the year at healthy double digits. Now we've got St. Jude in the mix there, so there's extra healthy double digits. But even on top of just last year on a comparable basis, there's a double-digit earnings growth target here, which, again, I would point out, is not typical across our peer group or competitors, et cetera, or even the companies that our investors compare us to, many of which are not health care. And so we start the year with healthy double-digit target and guidance, and then the gating of that guidance over the quarters. As you may recall in the first quarter, the issue was, gee, it looks back-end loaded. And our fourth quarter is always strong, and our first quarter is always the low quarter of the year. And so when you look at that and you say, okay, the investor tends to think that last quarter, gosh, that looks like such a big hill. So we have a strong first quarter, that tends to be the case. We tend to have lower guidance then, and we tend to beat it each year. It tends to be a pattern. And then there's -- I look at each year a little superstitiously. I guess if you've been around long enough, you get to see this. But every year, exchange or something happens later in the year, where there's a change, there's a political change, there's an exchange adjustment of some kind or whatever. So I'm reluctant to adjust guidance in the first quarter for almost anything and -- because I'd like to see the year play out a little more first because I don't like to whip around the shareholders, particularly when we're already looking at a double-digit growth target, which is annual for us. And so I look at it and say, okay, we're off to a nice strong start. We have had a bit of favorable exchange. We do know there's some timing in there, and there's also some strength in there. And I'd like to see that strength sustained, and I'd like to see the exchange sustained. I'd like to see more than 3 months play out here. So in the meantime, my view would be, let's take some of the gating off the back part of the year. Let's re-gate this a little bit more gently, call it a little smoother, and let's wait to see another card played in the second quarter. I just don't think it's prudent at this early point in the year to make adjustments to earnings that are already double-digit targets until we see more cards played.

1404799,77537906,1973913,405277,Celanese Corporation,"Yes. I think it's -- they're all related, but I think it is more around the pricing. I mean look, the last time we saw the low $300 per metric ton pricing for acetic acid was in 2016. So it's been a long time since we've seen this level of numbers. So I think it really is more about seeing the pricing go up. Now, that really means demand recovery for acetic acid, again, really dependent on China for that. I think that's where we'll see the recovery in the margins. But clearly, as we have demand recovery, we get some volume recovery that helps the prices go up. Again, we're pretty agnostic to what happens to oil in this scenario. We -- that's the beauty of our model, the beauty of having 3 different sources of the acetic acid around the globe that we can pull on depending on what's the best source and the lowest cost source. So I don't see oil price being a big factor for us. But certainly, China demand, China exports, reopening of India and Southeast Asia, these are going to be the big factors that can help drive those margins back up.",1
2565,68906450,1759560,286548,MBIA Inc.,"Good. Good question. Interestingly the underwriting guidelines do not vary considerably between the HELOCs and the closed end Second loans. However we have seen a pattern emerge or emerging. Most borrowers and many within the industry felt that housing crisis will continue to increase though at reduced levels and that led many borrowers to over leverage themselves for home improvement and speculation. We think that there is a lot of speculation out there, because the thought patterns was that if payments got too difficult to handle, the borrower could sell, many borrowers had covered themselves with local mortgages. The originators either did not verify income, asked the borrower to state their income or in many cases limited verification to something less than 24 months. Additionally the mortgage companies, because they were originating reduced documentation loans did not pay attention to borrowers’ debt levels and generously offered mortgages that allowed the borrower to put little or no equity into the property. So, reality hit when housing crisis started to decline precipitously in some MSAs. We feel that because the HELOC product offered borrowers the option of paying interest only for a five or ten year period, that encouraged speculative borrowers to prefer HELOCs over closed and second loans and you will recall from my comments some of the characteristics on the closed end second loans that include we think a different type of borrower attracted to and more stable fixed interest rate and fixed payments environment as opposed to the interest only HELOC deals that we insured.",-3

It will be the team's efforts around continuing to improve penetration, the quality of the portfolio, which we've seen some very nice improvements on here of late.

406651,26892581,592283,3004786,"Carter's, Inc.","Sure. For the full year, we're planning gross margin rates to be down a bit, more so in the first half of the year versus the second. We didn't take action in the first half to completely offset the impact of higher product costs in the first half. We took much more complete action, much more significant pricing action in the second half to narrow that gap. So for the full year, we are expecting gross margin rates to be down a bit. There's a few other headwinds that are in that as well. We have the tremendous benefit of shifting to the higher gross margin direct-to-consumer businesses. We are expecting that the deterioration of the Canadian dollar in Canada, which is a very high gross margin business, that will depress things a bit. Japan, while it was a very small business was an extremely high gross margin business. We are planning for some additional freight expenses as well in anticipation of this port strike on the West Coast. Other costs that we expect will be incurred regardless whether the strike happens or not because we've already begun to reroute products to other ports. So on balance, I think the long-term outlook for gross margin looks good. We were not anticipating product cost increases of this magnitude for the entire year. To your question on first half, second half, average costs are up about 7% in the first half and up about 6% in the second half of the year.",-3

I think if you go back and look at the earlier transitions in this space, they have largely been around delivering, and I don't want to say incrementally better, but a better performance for mobile devices that are connected to the network already. So when you go from 3G to 4G, you get better data performance. You're happier with your apps on your phones, et cetera. This is a step-level difference because we're talking about the latency dynamics of 5G and the belief that this will actually enable them to deliver real-time business applications to small offices or remote branches over 5G networks. That's a completely different dynamic. And so I would tell you that we're -- we don't know yet. But I think if you operate under the assumption that it lives up to its billing, then it is going to create a significant demand on the core networks of the service providers. And so I can't say that there's a huge historical example for us to learn from.

And what they've been able to do over the past year or 2 is really diversify the distribution more and more every day, which gives us more ability to manage that inventory, and also sell additional product, like shore excursions that we weren't able to before. And then I think, obviously, we want to continue to evolve that, and we want to continue to evolve the destinations that are in that area. And we've been very successful with getting Chinese consumers to sail for longer periods of time to more marquee ports, for example, like Tokyo.

But what's happening is we're putting in approximately another $250 million of capacity with the new plant that's coming up. And we've been hesitating in sourcing more because we thought we'd have to use majority of our efforts to sell up the ramp-up of the other one. We've changed our view given the growth of the industry, and we think that we can sell up the ramp-up as it's coming up and more source so we're doing both. The longer-term view is, it takes us about 12 to 18 months to add new capacity. And we'll make decisions on an incremental basis, and we'll continue sourcing more and balance the two. And we really don't have to have a final decision. We just have to decide when we're going to increase more LVT and what rate we're going to put it in and then adjust the sourcing strategy to go with it as we go through.",1

On the safety side, it is a relatively small business for us. We don't produce any of the PPE masks or gloves directly. We have those co-packed.

And frankly, on a personal basis, I was spending more time with hospitals and those types of organizations to just try to get them ramped up as quickly as they possibly could. So we were very, very focused on customers.  
I'd say over time, though, I mean, discussions with my peers and other companies, it's really focused more on the longer-term benefits of work from home, the realization that people are as productive as they were in the office, and in many cases, more so. There's a lot of conversations going on about real estate, around travel, around large conferences and those types of things. 
I think it's too early to say that we've got meta trends that are in place, but I think it's conversations that people are realizing that this is not just a set of capabilities that should be available to a limited subset of your employee base, but can be looked at on a much more broad basis and thought of it as just part of your overall infrastructure.

Once we have the new 100% in place and the old 100% shut down, I think that's when you will see the true read-through of the savings on a net basis, and there is a small element of that in 2012 but the majority of it is in 2013.",1

As you know, whether it's our type of equipment with the vessels, the high-end vessels or the drillships or the semisubmersibles, we're all kind of in the same boat, excuse the pun. But getting qualified mariners for all that equipment will take some lead time. During the upcycle, we did pack the pipeline with a lot of qualified mariners, did a lot of training. This is still a great industry to come back to when it kicks back up again. But it is at a price, and it is at a cost. And that's why I think longer term, right now, the oil industry is really pushing down on the backs of the service companies to get cost down. But there's only so much cost we can really go down. 2/3 of our daily cost are crew. And that's in indicative throughout the industry. And if we shut it down and then we have to get these highly complimented, like you said, brain surgeons back. It's not going to be cheap. So that cost structure will go back up as the green shoots start and the industry comes back. But in the interim, it make absolutely no sense for companies to keep equipment in the market to subsidize the industry and just burn all of their crash because that's what's happening today.

From an activation perspective, if you think of activation in total, would have been around $275 million for the year. What we sold off in terms of revenue forecasted to Sequential was around $200 million. Of that $60 million to $70 million remaining, about half of the revenues associated with SpeechCycle were revenues associated with the SpeechCycle, Mirapoint sales. And then obviously, we're going to sunset a piece of it, small amount, maybe $20 million-or-so of revenues. And then the remaining component, we're going to talk about at Mobile World.

So if we were to look in Seating, there are opportunities, if there's a captive-type opportunity in seats that is with a particular OE might become available and might make sense for us or, regionally or geographically, how we can continue to accelerate our growth within a particular region, like Asia or China. E-Systems, the acquisitions we've had just continue to create value proposition for our customers with the most recent one with EXO.

383919,25436778,557109,33054673,Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation,"So I think there is a couple of dynamics. First of all the average portfolio is not for 4.7x, right, it's 4.5x to 4.7x, which is the blend of the ones and twos, which is what we have. The ones, when you think of our ones in the portfolio, those are the ones most dangerous to repay. So you see those leveraged at 2.67x. And the reason they're at 2.67x is they had a lot of amortization, they've done well. So their leverage ratio is dropped, while new loans have not started to amortize. In fact, in the first year it's very lighter than any amortization, almost every one of our loans. But as they start amortizing in year 2 and/or start performing, that leverage ratio drops. So a lot of why you see the leverage ratio increase is simply the fact that we've replaced, unfortunately for us, right, a lot of the old loans with new loans, but we really have not been more aggressive in the market. We're really still on average, coming in at around 4x, 5x to start. And at 4x, 5x, we hope to get that number delevered overtime by amortization and by amortization and hope that company grow in at least modestly.",1

And so if we do a lease today, in all likelihood, there won't be build-out for a significant period of time in 2020. But net-net, the space that is available today and the space that is rolling over in the General Motors Building would have a positive contribution of about $27 million. And we currently have $13 million from that pool of assets today. So you can divide by 12 months and figure out what you -- how you want to think about that.
And then the other major exposure we have is we have, I said this before, in excess of 0.5 million square feet of known expirations in our Reston portfolio in the beginning of 2020, and the average rent is about $50 a square foot. So you can put a number of about $25 million on that. So there's a higher probability of us getting some of that back sooner because we have tenants that are in some of that space that are expanding and we have space that is currently built out and ready for occupancy, and therefore, we can recognize revenue earlier. So that's -- those are the sort of the 2 big building blocks. 
I just want to add one more thing. And the other thing I said, which is important, is that we have cash revenue at 159 East 53rd Street. And because that's one of our leases, they have to start. But they have been delayed in their planning and their construction documents for that 195,000 square feet. And you'll notice in our supplemental, we pushed out the stabilization date because we just -- we're a little unsure as to right now as to when they're going to complete their build-out of that space.

We're satisfied that that high conversion rate from EBITDA to cash flow in addition to the fact that we put a very modestly sized revolver in place that the free cash flow generated by the operations in conjunction with the work that Steve and the rest of the financial group has done by way of centralizing cash management and in conjunction with the revolver. Between those 3, the business is generating more-than-adequate cash flow to support the operations and service our balance sheet, just embedded in the plans that were described to our investors on the roadshow. That's number 1. Now to be crystal clear, if we were to do any acquisition of substance, we would then have to look at the availability of the free cash flow and how that would or would not have to be supplemented with debt and/or additional equity. So in the normal course, sans that, I'm of the view that the business between the trough and the free cash flow, that is the conversion from EBITDA to cash, the centralized cash management, which has allowed us to -- or will allow us, frankly, to eliminate peaking needs for each of our operations and the revolver cushion, we're well positioned to handle not only our normal business but unexpected situations, Thomas.",2

362070,24264972,530081,295170,Parker-Hannifin Corporation,"No. I think that what we're willing to pay, I think we're pretty consistent on that. We do a valuation here, and we're pretty -- we haven't really changed our method of evaluating or coming up with a value in our discounted cash flow approach over the years. It's been pretty stable. The ones that we're looking at are not in the $1 billion category for the most part. I mean, there's only a handful of those that we would consider. If they were available or actionable, of course, we're always looking at those as well, but I would say are more in the range of $100 million to $300 million kind of size range. Maybe even some that are a little less than that would be the ones that we're looking at today. Again, though, it's hard to say what we're going to get to the finish line. We did about $0.5 billion last year. I would've done more last year if we could have gotten more to the finish line. But we did $0.5 million, which is 4-point some percent of sales. I'd love to do that much again this year. We're going to have to get some moving down the pipe and get them to the finish line here to be able to pull that off. 
If not, though, like I said before, if not, we'll figure out what else to do with the allocating capital elsewhere, and we don't want to continue to build up a lot of cash on the balance sheet for the long term. So we'll figure out what to do there.",1
814565,51323974,1267663,126411,Trimble Inc.,"Sure. Yes. So again, I think we're taking relatively great pains to try to qualify the OEM opportunity in Building and Infrastructure, which is not so much as an end onto itself but a means to an end. And so I think that if you really look at the next year or 2 or 3, for that matter, the dollar revenue coming directly from the OEMs is not going to be a topic of great -- a great deal of conversation on our part. It's more of the strategic leverage that we're getting, really, in the aftermarket. So we really are seeing the OEMs as a means to access the aftermarket, is install a box -- there are different models here, but in a simplistic way is think about installing a box on the machine in the factory that already has a Trimble layer of intelligence on it. It goes to the aftermarket ends up in the hands of a contractor who may have 3, 4, 5 different machine types, different colors, different manufacturers. And the concept would be our distribution goes and visits that contractor and effectively sell software, potentially other services on top of the capability represented in the box. So hopefully, if this all works right, is the relatively larger part of the value add will take place in the aftermarket, will be in the form of software and services more so than the value implicit in the box in the factory. So again, the revenue is nice, but we ultimately expect the larger part of the revenue to come from the aftermarket and to see the box being installed in the factory, kind of maybe a literal box or a virtual box being installed in the factory, being a kind of a means to an end relative to the end being the aftermarket revenue. As far as the question on acquisitions in terms of kind of the -- where we go looking for them, I think that, one, we take a fair amount of pride in being an international company. I think we do view the international market kind of holistically, and so we would not think in terms of domestic or foreign or domestic and abroad. So I think that we have demonstrated a fair amount of capability of arbitraging kind of technology sources from around the world, whether it be India or we've got a strong Nordic presence, we have a strong German presence. We have capability in a lot of places around the world. So I think that we would be, in a sense, indifferent relative to the nationality associated with acquisitions and would simply look for the best fit, the best value creation capability. And at least at the moment, we're not particularly consumed by kind of geopolitical considerations. That may come, but aside from the obvious places to avoid, we're not really including that very directly into our calculation on acquisitions.",1

The Square Capital portion that sits on our own balance sheet is still small relatively. So we're sitting at about $58 million on our balance sheet. Cumulatively, we've now done over $2 billion in Square Capital originations that was facilitated. So just normal course of business. Recall, we typically use our balance sheet for areas where we are still early and curing the data. So products like consumer installments, even products like some of our partnerships. So segueing into that, the important thing with the partnership platform is getting access to the similar sort of data that we see with Square payments, which then helps educate our model so that they can make the right risk trade-off on where to go offer that capital to. So clearly, with partners like Upserve, originally, which does a point-of-sale more geared towards the restaurants world, a partner like Caviar, frankly, who also clearly is bringing in restaurant-type customers, big commerce seeing a lot of sellers business online, and these are all great partners because they're bringing that same type of data that can flow through the models that we have built for our competitive advantage are. It also allows us to serve that loan back in a really seamless way. I think as Jack talked about in the last question, as competitors come and go, what is beautiful about the product is it's getting served to you in your dashboard, where you see your business, and we're actually matching the repayment against how your business is performing. And you can really only do that when you're in the payments flow. And so that's why we look for those partners. It's why we believe we can be very additive to those partners, and it's why we built it in a very scalable platform like way so that as we work with someone like big commerce, they don't need engineers on their side to make this work. We've made it now so plug-and-play that new partners can come on in a really seamless, easy, fast way.",2

So I don't know if that makes sense for you. And then on an FX basis, we did see some strengthening a little bit in the currencies that I've mentioned.

We would definitely be a beneficiary if you are, and Match is the -- by far and away, the biggest beneficiary inside the family. But the mobile applications business, which we are just talking about, would also benefit for sure. I don't -- I can't think of anywhere else that it would matter. 
The -- your other question was M&A. I don't think we're getting more aggressive in M&A. I think that we are -- perhaps, we have just more opportunities today than we did 12 or 24 months ago. Again, mobile applications, as we were just talking about, I certainly would not have said M&A is available in the Applications business some time ago. And now that we've got a system there, that is available. I don't think -- again, maybe perhaps picking on the word. I don't think that's more aggressive. It's just that now that fits within our acquisition criteria. I think in the last 12 months, we've been integrating HomeAdvisor and Angie's List, which is a massive project, which I think the team there did phenomenally well. And so now that we've digested that, I think, again, back to the same criteria, that is not -- M&A is now available again there. And maybe that applies in more places. And I guess that answers -- start to answer the other part of your question. We certainly do favor tuck-ins and we'd certainly do favor smaller. I think that that's just -- those have a higher chance of success, and we have a greater embedded competitive advantage when we do acquisitions like that. 
I say this a lot, but I'll -- I know I'll repeat myself by saying, when we do acquisitions in our existing categories, we believe we can be the smartest people in the room because we know that category well, because we've seen every business model in that category, because we know what metrics look like in that category. I think that means we could be smarter than other buyers. Sometimes that means we can know the business or the potential better than the seller. And so that's where we'd like to emphasize our capital.

1375319,75940555,1931703,344284,iStar Inc.,"Yes. Interesting, I think what we're seeing from third parties now is a recognition of the cash flows coming off these ground leases, big enough, very safe, diverse, do look a lot like some of the highest-grade, long-duration bonds out there. 
And so if you look at similar credit quality, similar credit risk and term securities that trade every day on the screen, we're seeing that methodology that we thought was appropriate, start to be adopted by a number of third parties. 
So first step in valuation was just getting people to see that cash flow stream and use the appropriate discount rates. And we're starting to see that reflected, again, in the share price. 
That alone, I think, justifies a price well above where we've seen the stock trade. We also are now starting to share with people based on last year's significant growth, a sort of future-looking component, what are the future deals and future cash flows going to create? 
Again, this is a unique business, we actually think we're creating significant above-market returns. So we're not just buying commodities. We're actually creating a fundamentally new business that still has excess returns in it because it costs a lot of money to build the machine to actually serve our customers. So there's a second component there. And that will come down to what you think our growth rate is and where you think future pricing will come out. 
And then as you point out, the third piece is the residual piece, which in an individual ground lease probably doesn't have a lot of value, idiosyncratic risk, long time frames, discount rates that are probably north of the growth rates. So we haven't spent a lot of time sharing, sort of the thought process around any individual ground lease residuals. What we have been doing is tracking for you and for others, the amount of value-building up in that account, what we call the unrealized capital appreciation. And we think that's a real asset. And we are going to come back to you with a number of thoughts around how that can and should be valued. But that is something that requires the scaling, the diversifying that Marcos talked about. It doesn't make sense to talk about it on individual deals. But as we get larger, as we continue to scale, you will see us begin to focus on that component more heavily. 
Right now, Jade, to be honest, we just want people to get the cash flow piece right. Because even that, we still think is significantly undervalued. So in time, we think all 3 pieces will get valued by the market. But the first, the straight -- most straightforward, the one that everybody should be able to see right now, even that one, we're still trying to knock down some inaccurate views. And once that happens, again, I think you'll see a number per share that will make everyone pretty happy.",2
266145,19730985,418228,35572,Tidewater Inc.,"It won't. And I think there's a couple of points that's worth making is we've highlighted the retroactive portion of what our otherwise rate increases that we will benefit from a go-forward basis. We don't have much of adjusted data in the quarterly -- the intended quarterly filing, so you'll have to rely on the transcript for that. But it's really -- we experienced this to a smaller degree, I believe, in the June quarter of 2012, but my recollection was a $2 million or $2.5 million benefit to us. And it's really just the way the calendar works sometimes with clients is that we have fleet negotiations that go past the expiry date on the contracts. And so we'll continue to work and as we work things up through our own chain of command and then the clients' chain of command and finally reach to an agreement on rates. They have been retroactive to the start date or the rollover date of contracts. And again, this year, we recognized a more significant retroactive portion of a rate increase, but we did experience it to a smaller degree in fiscal '12. And it's just very possible that we would experience it on a go-forward basis, but it's very difficult to predict when and then what magnitude.",1
98668,11251103,183514,91797,R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company,"Craig, I think as Dan illustrated or talked about, our ratio -- leverage ratio being 2.5 to 3x, it is where we're comfortable with. I think if you look to see what we've done in the last couple of months and actually this year, the technology capabilities that we've added, some underneath the CustomPoint Solutions Group, some not, but, they're not thought about in a graphics industry as us going ahead and taking on such properties. But when you think about -- we already handle secure information and we receive digital content for the products that we routinely print, but as a provider of communication solutions, our customers have need for content. Helium provides that source of content. It can be used for creating publications, book, enhancing websites. More and more of our customers want their website to be the destination place for people, whether during the day or in the evening when they come home. And we're doing it in a cost-effective manner down to the individual level of that particular participant. When you think about monetizing content, Press+ does that. They offer subscription immediate solutions. As I said before, they help generate revenue from any electronic device. And light box provides targeted marketing messages based upon realtime online behavior. LibreDigital, the e-reading services, they serve book, they serve periodical distribution as well as B2C sales, which again is something that Donnelley hasn't participated in. Sequence personal has a system for creating custom publications. They can do that on the fly. They can distribute it electronically or support it by our expensive digital print network. And then when you think about Nimblefish, multichannel marketing and integrating direct response, customized video and pearls to enhance customer loyalty. All of these things here -- it would be a remiss by not mentioning 8touches that has the self-service online marketing templates. But our customers, whether they're the publishers, the Fortune 1000 companies or even the governments, they want their content to be sent to their end users in multichannels. They can't exist without having numerous suppliers. We're fitting that bill right now.

So this year is not a good benchmark, but I think it helps inform and influence and set us up for a strong year in 2019, because we have every expectation that we're going to remove those inefficiency costs that we've seen throughout 2018 and then do way more than that with the Unified Plan 2020. So it's a big number. I can't tell you how to model other than we're showing confidence in our ability to drive productivity and, as we've said here, we're confident that -- or our belief at this point at the early planning phase is that volume will be on the positive side of the ledger and we're just as confident as ever on our ability to drive price above inflation. So from a modeling standpoint, you'll have to, kind of, take those parameters and do what you think the economy is going to look like.

As far as the retail on the RV side, this sounds a little crazy, but boy, if we can get 3 months of good weather here, especially in the spring buying season, things can turn on the dime in this industry, just as quickly as they can really come to a really slowing effect with bad weather. People have to be out there touching the product to buy it. And they don't like to do that in snowstorms and tornadoes and thunderstorms.

And year-over-year, we did, obviously, add some people, and the base we're going off of -- I just want to ground everybody, I think Carlos said this. Last year, we we're clearly in a decelerating decline as far as the overall macro. So we were watching everything. We had stuff locked down very tight. So obviously, we were able to maintain very strict cost controls last year. As we go forward, we typically have our merit increases every October 1. We added some people. 
And then on the Industrial side, we have some of the sales force, because they were up obviously 6% and of course, we're paying some sales commissions. Adam, without getting too specific, I would say that it was probably an equal increase across those, with the headcounts, the merit and some of the sales commissions. They're the main drivers. But it's always like a Catch-22. You can't wait until you have growth to start adding people. So we started adding people, obviously, towards the end of last year into the first quarter in both businesses. I think you see a bit quicker payback on the Industrial side, given the early cycle, and I think we're looking at that closely, as well as some of the opportunities on the Infrastructure side. 
Now that's a little bit softer, but they're a little bit longer projects. So it takes a little bit longer. You don't get significant payback quicker. So we'll see a little bit more of a return faster on the Industrial side going forward. And with a little bit -- maybe longer, but we still think we need the right investments as it relates to the Infrastructure side of the house. So the payback will be a little bit different. I think it will be quicker on the early cycle than the later. But we think longer-term, some of the bigger projects and the growth that's fragmented there will be opportunistic.

If you look at our variable costs of production in the quarter, they declined as compared -- on a unit basis as compared to our variable costs of production in the first quarter of last year. And as Don mentioned, that was predominantly labor efficiency offsetting diesel fuel. Our cash period costs, and period costs in our way of -- in our terminology is your fixed costs. Those -- the spending at the cash period costs level was flat year-over-year, so we've got 10% additional volume. So that same level of cash spending is being spread over more tons. And if you look at the supplemental schedules, you'll see that our depreciation expense in the various business segments is declining as well. So the dollars of non-cash fixed expense are being -- are not only declining, but being spread over a larger amount of tons. I should also point out that in the quarter, we also reduced our units of Aggregates inventory as well by several million tons. So we got this level of operating leverage on a level of production that was less, that increased less than the increase in the level of sales.

Obviously, starting with folks like yourself and shareholders where we consider dividends, stock repurchase. I also think the ability to have some fairly quick action on acquisitions, by having some cash in the bank to enable us to do some quick decisions and not have to wait on financing, for instance, is a help as well. I look at customers and there, the ability to make the critical investments from both a capital expenditure and IRAD perspective, our independent research and development. I think having some consideration for addressing potential continuing resolution impacts in advance of sequestration impacts, including the effects of small suppliers and being able to decide what makes sense from a disruption perspective as far as helping some of those smaller suppliers through these periods of funding uncertainty, I think, is also helpful. I look at employees as another constituent, and that's -- primarily, that relates to funding the pension plan, which I think we've demonstrated our willingness to do that quite long, or for quite some time. And lastly, I look at debt holders. And there, I think maintaining the appropriate ratings levels relative to our desires going forward, keeping a balance between the demands of equity holders and debt holders is a critical element there as well. And I think the question is sort of maintaining that balance and maintaining that flexibility going forward. I think Chris has one other add here.",1
1098529,63489081,1611215,107911,Tenet Healthcare Corporation,"So this is Eric. I'd answer a couple of those questions. So first of all, when we look forward, capacity utilization still remains -- we have, in our remaining markets, we have plenty of capacity support, obviously, our growth perspectives -- and our capacity utilization is a little higher in the markets that we're keeping, obviously, the ones we're getting rid of. But I would say that from a go-forward perspective, when you think about pricing, we're continuing to focus on high-acuity items or high-acuity service lines. And so you're seeing that growth show up in the revenue. It's the same thing we're seeing in our ERs. If you look at the level 1 and 2 visits, they're down slightly, the level 4 and 5s are up about 3%. So we continue to expect that acuity is going to drive a fair part of that, along with the managed care agreement terms that we've already negotiated. So we feel good about the pricing. From a service line perspective, if you look at the markets we're in, that we have -- that remain in, because of the markets we divested, our market share is up approximately 6 points in those markets. We feel better positioned than ever. 80% of those markets we're #1 or 2 in, and we're working very closely with Brett to not just be looking at the inpatient market share but really be thinking about kind of what does the health care system look like in a market. And we think that positions us well to, again, grow the high acuity in our hospitals and also grow overall outpatient volume in the USPI assets.",3

It's the MTO area that's been a bit more of a challenge, and we did see incoming order rates improve throughout the quarter, and we expect that to be a better result in Q2. 
I don't know if I can commit to that, that's going to be a positive comp at this point in time. And then on the dealer and distributor space, we have seen that trend improved as well, I believe, in April -- kind of the March, April, May time period, all 3 of those months in that space, we were down double digit, and we've seen that come back quite nicely in June and July.",2

One day the market can be up 200 basis points likely it’s down 200 basis points and so we are trying to manage all of the growth with a very conservative balance sheet and post-this offering, our debt, our total debt to net worth is like 0.6:1.
And if you look at any of the peers in our space and really go and look at their balance sheet, they are highly leveraged. We are trying to do this in a way where we are not really leveraging ourselves. And I have said before that we are generally going to keep our total debt to worth ratios under one-to-one. You are right that part of the capital raising have to what the opportunities might be. So, we have to wait really to see what happens in Europe here over the next, really, month because we’ve got three fairly large acquisitions we’re right in the middle of right now that may or may not happen.

678118,45189230,1080586,395750,Entercom Communications Corp.,"Well, it starts from -- we're in an enviable position right now with a very strong balance sheet that's only gotten stronger now through our refinancing, with over $2 a share of free cash flow. But I think it's also important to note that we've been a very disciplined steward over the years, and that's going to continue. We're comfortable with our current level of leverage, but we also like the idea of continuing to delever in taking advantage of the free cash flow. We do have a couple of upcoming uses of capital, the facility -- the execution of the Charlotte purchase, and then, in addition, we will ultimately take out the preferred, as we've touched on, probably sometime in 2017 as well, which will be an accretive event to us. And beyond that, we'll -- our dividend is a relatively small, I think it's a relatively small share of our free cash flow, roughly 15% of trailing free cash flow on a pro forma basis. So that's something I'm sure the board will think about over time. And we'll continue to look, again with a very disciplined eye, towards value creation in M&A, and I think our balance sheet gives us a -- puts us in a nice position to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. But, again, we'll do so opportunistically but without feeling any compulsion or necessity to do so.
So I think we're in a great position, and I'm excited about where we are for the remainder of this year and into 2017 and beyond.",3

The other component relates to this migration of open loop card portfolios onto our issuing bank contracts for certain acquisition-related entities.

If you look at that, it does quarter-by-quarter on a trailing 12 months. And you'll see that there's a much smoother line there, if you will. We always talk about the business being lumpy. So if you compare that with the signings in the main deck, you'll see how that smooths out the lumpiness a little bit. The only one to take a look at is you'll see a little bump in early 2014, which is we had kind of -- we had very high signings when we were clearing through that excess inventory that had been built over the prior kind of 1.5 years or so. So that's a good illustration of how the -- if you look over time, longer time frames, the lumpiness gets smoothed out.",1

It's been one of our really strong points, a resilient part of our business during the pandemic. We ended the year with a good book of business. We'll enter next year with a good book of business. If you go back to Q4 of last year, a lot of the -- some of the pricing activities that we saw flow through the first 3 quarters began last year in the fourth quarter. Some of the operational and some of the mix improvements that we made, we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. So the comp of last year included a lot of the operational and pricing improvements that we have benefited from in the first 3 quarters of this year. 
As we look into next year, we do see a modest organic decline. We see maybe a modest margin decline. But that being said, we still think we have a lot of opportunities for that to be a solid contributor. And as Gene said, this is one of the opportunities, I think, that for continuous improvement, there's a lot of dollars there that the Lean process, 80/20 process will be very well-suited to help us gain some margin improvement there as well.",-2

And then we also have customers who, for budget purposes, they happen to have dollars available. It's just easier for them to get this thing off the decks and move on to other budgeted projects. Now we don't give people discounts for this activity. So it's not a financially incentive behavior. This is really only done at the customer's convenience. And so we had more of that activity this quarter than we've historically seen, so it was a bit of a surprise.

Certainly, don't have any other color to add there. It's -- again, it's something that we see sometimes a little bit more obvious, sometimes a little bit less of.

It's not as clear to me that there are breakout examples yet in the more serious hard news categories. However, what I do want to say, I mentioned VR as an example of an innovation by The Times in video. We are looking, we are in the process of changing leadership in video. I expect to continue to invest strongly in video. I think there is much more we can do. We've seen with T Brand Studio how we can bring innovation and creativity and get really dramatic revenue growth in the business by finding the right creative solutions. I'm working very closely with Dean Baquet, with Meredith, with Kinsey Wilson and others in looking at video with a view to say over the last couple of years, we've done a lot to improve the quality of video. I think we've got a lot to be proud of there. We've been gathering many awards from that. In terms of scale and impact, I don't think we've yet achieved as much as we can. And one of the areas I look to growth in 2016 and the years after that is by significantly beefing up the impact and ultimately the revenue we get from video.",1

I think their refinery is performing very well. If you look, we performed work in the fourth quarter that will allow us and as Fred said to run that -- close to capacity the first quarter. So the operation itself is doing very well. Second, the -- we had an initiative to play in between LLS and Midland. And as Midland, LLS was widened or was wide, during the fourth quarter, we ran almost 60% of Midland base. And together with the ability to utilize the Paline Pipeline and reduce transportation costs, that's helped on that side of the business. Third, we are starting to work on the wholesale along the Colonial. If you remember, we said in the past that the fact that Krotz is selling everything at the refinery gate doesn't serve the refinery very well. And with the fact that -- we have Colonial space, as a combined company, that allows us to ship on Colonial and capture more or higher margin on the wholesale side. These components, again, we had 2 quarters. We expect the first quarter to continue with that trend. I wouldn't declare victory as we need to continue to improve. But I'm going to give you another piece of news on the alky project, which is progressing very well, and we're hoping to finish it in the first -- towards the end of the first quarter of next year, i.e., a year from now with aim -- with the widening or the increase of WTI price and the fact that isobutane didn't keep up with that. We see bare margins and result of this alky project in the past, we used to say $35 billion to $40 billion. We now believe, based on core markets, that this number is higher. Our goal is to get close to a situation at the survival refinery. And last point, the -- because of the good operation at Krotz and the leadership of the refinery manager, we are able to improve the year losses or year's gain. In the quarter, we were enjoying 101.5, i.e. 1.5%  [ bare, or yield]  gain versus in the past, some lower numbers. So these are the factors that contribute to the performance of the refinery.",2

We paid a GE under the CSA, which we don't have to pay when half the train is not running and just other consumables, chemicals, refrigerants, all of that, so it largely offsets.

The greatest impact of -- in Poland was, I think we shared with you in the second quarter, we saw a sudden, I'll call it a deluge of imports into Poland, which really complicated matters and volumes, and prices declined really dramatically. Third quarter, those prices began to recover and some of the volume as well. And the fourth quarter is just a kind of a continuation of that. We also did take a write-down of a fab business of about $3 million, which also impacted the quarterly results, making it look a little bit worse than it was. But we've seen some improvement, both in volume as well as in pricing. We expect the Polish market to remain difficult, however. We're going into the winter time when things are less -- are more volatile and there's less activity. And margins do get squeezed, so that's typical. And we're working on our mix of merchants versus rebars and still a lot of upside on shipping more merchant. But the same phenomena that we have in the United States of what I'll call a premium for merchants isn't quite as large as it is in -- it's much larger in North America than it is in Europe. And I think that owes to the fact that there's not the same level of consolidation and more aggressive pricing on merchants, vis-à-vis rebar in Europe, particularly under the current economic conditions.

We certainly will be back in the market for renovating assets perhaps on a more selective basis in 2021 once we have completed that strategy.

So first just on the question on the Caribbean side, obviously, we've commented about being in a strong booked position and also with bookings accelerating for the Caribbean. I won't get into specifically by product what our booked position is, but what I will tell you for the third quarter is that we are in a strong booked position on both a rate and volume basis. And so, yes, we understand where the supply is. I think people should consider our dialogue around the booking window having extended for a period of time, us being in a very strong position of strength at the turn of the year. And so we've obviously been anticipating the supply that has been coming in to the different regions and products of the world. And -- but I would say that we are in a very good position for Q3. On the capacity side, I think that there -- obviously, our commentary about the booking environment is what we're seeing, which would include sailings in the 2019 period of time though it's still very early, but the acceleration of the strength that we're talking about also reflects what we're seeing in '19. I think when we consider demand, I think in -- we've been pretty consistent about this, there are some very strong demographic shifts, there are very strong consumer trends of people buying experiences versus stuff. Richard commented in his script about the perception of cruise on the rise, and we think levers like social media and so forth are really helping break through stereotypes on cruise. And we have seen a real change in our new-to-cruise volumes. That's also suggesting that a lot of these past detractors are becoming fans of cruise. And also, we continue to focus on penetrating the different markets around the world. We're expanding our footprint each and every year and penetration in all those different markets. So we think there's a lot of reasons why you -- investors and us are very excited about the future demand of cruise.

In fact we've funded a number of expansions or redevelopments, if you will, of our existing independent living and senior housing, to position our portfolio for that. In fact, that was one of the key reasons we went with Brookdale on the RIDEA joint venture we have. That was a central thought there in terms of the, a, the opportunity, but more importantly, Brookdale's ancillary revenue platform. So that's absolutely a trend that we like, a trend that we've taken advantage of, and a trend that we anticipate will continue going forward. I don't think we're in the camp where we would want to develop our own standalone memory care properties, Jeff. I think we view that as again, part of a continuum within either an actual CCRC sort of setting or effectively, a virtual CCRC setting when you've got operators that are in the process of putting critical mass into local markets. Now with respect to the second part of your question, which was development. Realize that we've got about a 5 or a 6 community development program right now that we talked about, Paul talked about in some length on last call. That is going well. It's -- we're ahead of where we thought we'd be. But I think we're going to be very moderate and disciplined in terms of ramping that up.

One, yes, we did have actually inventory drawdown in the first quarter of this year. So we did not have the build that you saw last year. So that's the first part of your question. 
I think the other part of your question is a really good one, and it's one I'm happy to try to address because I think this is an important notion for us to really hit very clearly. 
If we're looking at the first quarter of 2018 relative to products that went out, here's the way I would encourage you to think about it. 
About 25% of our product last year was base stone. Somewhere between 28% and 29% of it this year was base stone. Last year, almost 52.5% of it was clean stone. This year, 50%. Here's my point, Kathryn. If you're seeing more base stone glut today, that's newer projects that are beginning from the ground up and are likely to last a longer period of time. At some point, you're going to put asphalt over concrete on top of base stone, so we're going to get those clean stone sales as they come through. Greater base stone sales, in my view, is longer term nice projects that portend well for the balance of 2019 and really, I think, start to tell a good story for 2020. 
But here's what's important to it as we go through that. If we take a look at what our ASP on our heritage business would have been this quarter if we had had the same mix that we had last quarter, our ASP for heritage would have improved 6.1%. So that's a 210 basis point improvement. And we think seeing more base stone is attractive. We think that type of pricing growth to our heritage business is also attractive, and I do think I responded to your question relative to the inventories as well.",3

But the bottom line is getting better as there's more discipline around pricing, more discipline around the contracts that we're taking. So a lot of the bad news that we saw last year, bad news, surprises coming out of the U.K., for instance, again, sales aren't up in the U.K. but profits are now on the legacy F&S business just because of the discipline I think that Geraud and the management team has brought to the pricing process there.",2

We should be able to grow loans, we think, at mid-single digits at the whole company level even with all those forces. Let me give you an example. If you look at CRE, so this is when responsible growth kind of helps you, right? If you look at CRE, I think we've talked about in past quarters, we transformed our approach to commercial real estate lending. We're still very selective, focusing on top-tier companies, and we ensure we maintain a diversified portfolio across property type and geography. And if you look at our CRE portfolio as a percentage of our commercial portfolio, it's probably the lowest of the top 40 banks. Now having said all that, we're starting to see other banks pull back in CRE. And we're seeing more opportunities now with clients -- within our client selection and risk framework, we're seeing more opportunities. So in Q3 alone, year-over-year, CRE growth was up 3%. I think you're going to see things like that.

It's similar to what we experienced in 2011, is what our expectation is there, and that's the bigger part. We are seeing, as Michael mentioned, some inflationary cost areas in the equipment, repairs and maintenance area and then the tires area. We're seeing increases there that I haven't seen in my career. And so we're trying to do the best we can to get a handle on the equipment maintenance side by bringing on more of the 2010 series engines and ridding ourselves of some of the 2007, 2008.

Our rail and purchase transportation costs, we expect to be up there because we've seen, I think in the fourth quarter, maybe even a 10% increase in rail costs on a per mile basis. So there's some areas that cause us some concern whenever we look at 2012 on the cost side. But the good news is that we're continuing to see a pricing environment that is favorable in the fourth quarter. Our deferred pricing increases were close to 6%.

So directionally overall, margins are up. And then you’ve got the mix effect of the business that we have. So I’m not trying to be evasive on the response, it’s a mix-affected benefit to the business.

It is -- generally, as I've commented in the past, we expect regulatory credits to become a more meaningful part of our business. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's very difficult to forecast them.

The regulatory credits composition is a mixture of these particular deals that are onetime. There's also some that are production-based over time. The production-based ones are easier to forecast because it's based on cars that we build, and we get an offset to that way. The deal-specific ones are lumpier, which makes it more difficult.

And we haven't -- it's really early to kind of try to quantify the impact. I would point out, though, a resumption in Hawaii tourism will inevitably lead to not only an increase in jet fuel demand, but you're likely to see greater consumption of ground transportation fuels, especially on the Neighbor Islands. 
And as we start to see more demand on the Neighbor Islands, where you're likely to see an improvement in our profile first, will be in the Hawaii logistics because with the increase in demand in those Neighbor islands, whether it be jet fuel or ground transportation fuels, it will increase the utilization of our logistics assets, which will contribute to the bottom line. I think the jet fuel demand is such that we are likely to be in a position sooner rather than later where our Par East or our existing refinery is unable to support the jet fuel demand for the island, and we start importing to support all of the island demand. 
We probably only need to see about 50% of the passenger demand, and we'll be in a position where you have to start thinking about importing, and we've effectively fully utilized Par East. But that's not to say I want to be very clear. That doesn't mean that economically, it makes sense for us to startup Par West or we're justified and increasing because the cracks just aren't there.

We know that curve to 1,000 is going to take some time, but we want to -- I think of it like this, Jonathan. I think of it as right now, we're building Model Ts in Henry Ford's old factory, and we're about to turn on the assembly line. And so that's really what's on our mind. 
And so we're not capping our forecast, and that's why we're not giving an end date because we're working that plan with our engineers as we speak. The reason for announcing it before the plan was all noted down is because we wanted to get the input of critical stakeholders. 
We want to engage with our tribal leaders, with our environmental groups, with our local communities and determine the best place to do that undergrounding first. We know there's high demand for undergrounding. And so this is a great opportunity for us to engage with the people of California to change the risk profile of California and PG&E together.

It was something that we've been talking about for a period of time, and it just progressively got worse, and we reacted to it.",-3

One is that we think this is an opportunistic time to be a seller in the seniors housing market; and secondarily, these are portfolios that aren't a perfect fit for our strategy at this point. They're operators that, generally speaking, we're not growing with. And therefore, we're probably better off freeing them up to grow their business with a different capital partner. And helps to have existing portfolio to bring to the table for that. And for the most part, these have quite low payment coverage.

You are really inquiring about using sort of branded content within the Big Fish brand or another company using branded slots within their social casino brand. We, as a strategy, have not focused on doing very much of that because the owner of the licensed IP is another mouth that you have to feed. So we're -- certainly, there are plenty of people that are successful doing that. But we're just by nature and background always thinking about margin and always thinking about the cost in association with the revenue. So our first instinct is always to be a bit careful and considerate in our thinking about whether we want to pay more mouths out of our revenue stream. So we always weigh that. We do -- we are willing to do some of it. It just hasn't been our primary strategy for how to grow in the space. But other people are very -- you see them out there, other people have found great success doing that. So I hope there's more than one way to skin the cat over time, but the way Big Fish built its business and the way we think about it now, it's not a primary component of our philosophy to try to rely on branded IP.",0

194259,14833093,301366,27755,"Dun & Bradstreet Holdings, Inc.","Yes. So a couple of things. We try to view our business as a truly flexible business, where every dollar has to justify itself, and we do flex it with revenue. Our belief is that if our revenue falls short of our expectations, it is our obligation to flex our cost base appropriately. So let's talk a little bit about the mechanics of how this one works, because I think it's a good instructive example. Because we'll be down to a degree, we have some level of variable costs, so right off the bat, some of that stuff's going to fall out. We always go into the year, though, with a level -- we tend to be a conservative company, with a level of conservatism in our cost base. So we've got some contingency which we hold in the event that things don't work out perfectly. And we always have a continuous pipeline of new work that we're doing because we have a continuous reengineering model, and we typically space those out over time but we can accelerate them. In fact, if you look at last year, I think I mentioned on the last call, we did a Hoover's integration. We ended up doing that in the September period of last year. We'd originally anticipated doing that this year. So oftentimes, we will accelerate programs when it makes sense to do so. If you take a look at the overall impact and what we're covering right now, it's about 1/3 of it is from the [indiscernible] costs, about 1/3 of it is from the conservatism that we've built into the forecast and the last 1/3 is by bringing some of the reengineering programs forward.",-1

722221,47185850,1138664,318091,"Macy's, Inc.","Sure, I'll start. And Karen, you might want to fill in. But so to answer your question, Kimberly, first is the -- do we have a full set of strategies to address the needs to turn our business in the right direction? I'd say the answer is they're still developing. We're going to be talking about some of the strategies that we have developed in the near term. We've got a meeting planned for our internal organization to express some of these new ideas and thoughts. But I can assure you that there's more to do. We feel great about the progress, the investments we've made on our digital platform with our online business chugging along nicely and very well developed. As Karen said, the investments we've made in our Macy's app has been very positively received. So we're doing some good things there. But clearly, the answer has to lie in our conversion of consumers who are shopping in our physical stores into sales instead of just shopping and browsing and then clicking and buying either at macys.com or somewhere else, converting them into purchasers inside of our stores. And we've got test stores lined up, we've got a lot of exciting things that we're testing and doing. But as Karen alluded to, it'll be a bad idea for us to just roll those out immediately and hope they work. So rather, we're going to spend '17 to try various new formats that we do believe will improve our conversion rate. And then the ones that do work, as we've experienced and we've figure out with ladies' shoes and with fine jewelry, we'll do those and roll that out hopefully later in the season in '17 and '18. So those are still underway. And then to your point about is this different than the prior setbacks that we've faced? I would say, yes, it is different. But each time has been different. And so this time, I think the positive this time is that consumers have money to spend. They are spending on automobiles and they're spending on health care and they're spending on home improvement and they're spending on all those things. I actually thought that they would spend less on those items in 2017, believing that they have been spending in those same categories in '16. But that is not what happened. They continue to spend in those same categories in '17 -- I'm sorry, in '16 as they did in '15. And so at some point in time, you've got to believe that everybody's going to have a brand-new car. At some point in time -- we've just had record after record performance of automobile sales. At some point in time, there's dollars that are going to be freed up for other categories of spending. And when they get to these categories, we have to be a major consideration. So one of the key strategies that we are working -- we are performing well in our exclusive and unique product. And as we've mentioned, the product brand sales are doing better than the market sales. The brands that we have from the market that are sold only at Macy's, brands like Tommy Hilfiger as an example, are selling significantly better than the more broadly distributed brands. And so we have to work that out with our vendor partners because supply and demand has become a real issue here and an opportunity for those who are working with us.",-2

You see that moderating with many competitors now, but there are some, particularly one direct company who's still taking some pretty big price increases.

It's a -- strategically, I've been talking for some time, as really the mix does start to shift towards more of an opening price point consumer. Overall, big picture, it's much better for the industry. I think it will unleash some pent-up demand, both in R&R as well as new construction, move up and move down buyers and so forth.

But I think the bigger question is, right now, we're just not seeing a big shift towards that. The good thing is we -- like I said earlier is we can, I will say, control our mix. We do have influence over our mix on obviously what we bid. Pricing is still very high out in the market right now. The average square footage home is still very high.

At the end of the day, good project pipeline is going to generate kind of very good EBITDA growth. And as we said in our prepared remarks, some of these waste streams are bulk waste and bulk solid that have lower price points. It does not mean that our prices have not changed. It's actually gone up a bit this year. It's just that we haven't seen the mix of the business, which is a good thing. In my opinion, it's a good thing because we're using our new incinerator. Our landfills are getting good utilization. And we're kind of pleased with the back half program. And so the margins yeah, there's been some slippage in margin, but I'm not necessarily concerned about that. I think as we get the incinerator kind of up and fully all shook out and rolling well, we'll be able to take higher waste streams.

I mentioned previously that, that consolidation would generate north of $20 million a year in savings. We are harvesting and we're on track to realize those savings in our new Defense Group. So in some ways, we've focused on performance in the portfolio.

To Paul's point on the provisioning, I mean, I think we feel very comfortable that we've captured everything that we know today. We're hopeful that the decline in the economic forecast, the magnitude of that was the greatest in the second quarter, but the folks at Moody's and their PhDs know that better than we do. And as the quarter rolls on, we'll see how that goes. So that's always what's [indiscernible] in that.

70342,9684218,151111,269764,Entergy Corporation,"Good. The first part of the tag team is we're assessing the impact on the rule. Obviously, the issues for us stem around timing, where the EPA prior to what we knew was the transport rule before this funding by the EPA had -- we were assuming a 2014 effective date. We've now moved up under the rules to 2012. That certainly had an impact. And then when you combine the notion of allowances, all of those affect our perspective cost of compliance. And certainly, the fines. On the regulated did side of the fence, which Gary can talk to, obviously, there are assumptions made by the EPA regarding the retirement of plants in our regulated space quite candidly that are needed, whether it's reliability purposes, transmission of baseload, load following, ready, much-run designation. And there's a lot that we have to do to try and assess where that is, and it's a dynamic process for us. We're just not at a point right now, where we're taking a firm company point of view, because we ultimately have to determine what this means for our customers, and that's an iterative conversation with the regulators.

1294795,72521850,1853604,31726,Southwest Airlines Co.,"Yes. So just to make a few points on the first quarter, and I think this will help address your question. So excuse me if I'm a little bit redundant. But keep in mind, we've got the schedules out through first quarter 2020. And at this point, the MAX is canceled through February 8. So I just want to point out that we do have some conservatism built into our February schedule. We -- and again, all this is contingent upon the deliveries of how those resume from Boeing.
But based on what they've indicated, they are targeting here in the fourth quarter, we would expect to have around 50 MAX aircraft in our fleet at the beginning of February. And that, of course, includes the 34 MAX 8s that are currently grounded. Yet, we'll only have 30 MAX aircraft worth flying for sale in our February 2020 schedule. And that ramps to 65 aircraft in our March schedule. And as you all know, there's strong demand, and we have pent-up demand here at Southwest. So we'll want to ramp up prudently, but we certainly want to ramp up as quickly as we can to utilize our assets and to absorb some of the cost pressure that we're obviously experiencing here in the fourth quarter.
So currently, the largest step-up of aircraft coming back into service is from the seasonally off-peak February time period into March. And that's how we met to the current first quarter capacity number that you mentioned, which is up 2% to 3% year-over-year. And -- but most importantly, we'll want to be measured and deliberate in the way we introduce that MAX aircraft safely back into service. But all of these planning assumptions change if we have to extend our flight cancellations further. So hopefully, you can appreciate how difficult it is to announce -- nail down a solid plan and cost guidance for even this environment.
But all that said, we're focused on delivering solid results and focused on mitigating those cost pressures as much as we can. And of course, as always, our goal would be to have positive RASM in the first quarter. So we're looking to balance all of that.
So we'll have to manage our flight cancellation impacts of the schedule very carefully as each time period has its own set of unique challenges. But again, based on the current environment, I feel pretty good that we can do that.
So we expect the year-over-year unit cost penalty to continue, and we'll face those headwinds as we ramp back up. But we'll -- as we get past the MAX, the penalties that we've shared to you throughout the year, we would expect those to reverse and turn into a tailwind next year once we get past the return to service and we're back up to our normal capacity plans. So that was a long-winded answer, but that's -- I just wanted to give you a little bit of color so that you can appreciate how difficult it is for us to nail down cost guidance.",-2

The backlog is not huge right now, but the pipeline of work that we're seeing out there is unbelievable. There's just a tremendous amount of work that's being planned out there. And along these lines a little bit, I was out with a contractor -- Mark and I were out with a contractor last week, and he threw out a fascinating fact to me, that 2, 3 years ago -- he's large. He's very large. He does work across the country in multiple states.

And I'm sure some are thinking to go, well, hold it, I hear maybe somebody else 20% to 30% is as we had in our prepared remarks. We have destocking, we probably have more of a stockable product. I don't think distributors typically vary it. But just as they try to keep their days on hand appropriate. And if they used to have 4 or 5 weeks of inventory, they still have 4 or 5 weeks so 20% less inventory. That's a week of inventory coming out of this quarter, I think, 8%. So 30%, maybe in the upper 20s or low 20s percent. And then from there, I do think, without us being overly optimistic, as more states start opening up operations, and we get back to work, nothing significant there. But right now, as you would know, living in New England, from the Boston to New York City, it's virtually shut down at the moment. So a little bit of pickup.

As the cars get better, the warranty dollars tend to fade. So I think the spikes you see are really the recalls. And the great thing about the recalls to me is it gives you an opportunity to generate another customer pay or pay order. We've been pretty consistent with customer pay.

I think in kind of general buckets, as we've talked about transitioning out of our KBI noncore wheel bearings and as we mentioned during that conference, the margin profile of KBI was similar to our kind of machine and value-added content. And so as that, call it, roughly 3% of our business transitions out, there's certainly a volume impact. But again, it's a noncore part of our product. That will partially offset because if you just do the math, that would be a higher number than what you're seeing. The delta between the 2 is you've got a couple of other headwinds in terms of industrial markets. We saw that was a half year last year. We'll see a full year impact this year. And then, we also mentioned the Class 8 vehicles. But more than offsetting that is the cost reduction activities. We continue to do that. As George mentioned, we have an endless stream, is probably the right word. We continue to find various ways to improve our efficiencies and reduce costs in our businesses.

For us, capital allocation really has been - is first a function of getting the balance sheet in order. So you’ve seen much of the capital that we’ve been allocating over the last 2 years has been focused on strengthening the balance sheet in the last quarter. We spent about $25 million paying down debt, but when you combine the debt pay-down efforts that we’ve been undertaking with the incremental EBITDA that we’ve been able to generate, our leverage is now down to about 2.5 times, and we think that positions us very well to start looking at other alternatives. We are looking at acquisitions, we’re looking at add-ons like we mentioned earlier. Our share repurchases is also something that we always keep in mind. Specifically on the acquisition front, we don’t see a lot of activity in the market, but there are some potential transactions that we find-- are finding interesting. I don’t think it would be unreasonable for you to expect that you might see a tuck-on type acquisition here at Asbury before we get to the end of the year.",2

We also do that with our organic projects. So to Mark's point, this facility has been tested on the perspective of capital allocation and investment premise and value creation through that. So it doesn't really matter that we may be in an environment in 2018 where we have peak spreads. We use through-cycle spreads. We will measure that profitability. And we're not in a point in time yet to be able to talk about returns on the facility simply because we're still doing a lot of work along the time lines and looking at what the configuration will actually entail from a cost perspective.

1435482,78608788,2008299,292525,Eversource Energy,"Yes. So I will say that sales in the first quarter were down, both -- you'll see that on the electric side, they were down close to 6%. And on the gas side, nearly 14%. And I'd say 95% of those numbers are due to the incredibly mild weather we had in the first quarter. It's nothing to do with real COVID impacts. We really were only a couple of weeks into COVID in the first quarter. I mean in the weather in the first quarter in our service territory was, the heating degree days were the lowest in 50 years. That's 5-0. They're about 18% or 19% below the previous year and below normal. We have the longest January in 90 years. There's probably a hundred different statistics that can -- so the one benefit, as I mentioned, was it enabled us to execute very well on our capital plan, but it didn't do much for us in terms of sales. So that's really what we've seen there. 
I will say kind of going forward, April was actually pretty cool here in our region. So in a strange way, even though it's a shoulder month, I would expect maybe our gas business sales to be up in April despite COVID. I do think what you're going to see is a downward trend or downward pressure on the commercial sales. But where everybody is working at home, probably some upside benefit on the residential sales in the electric business. 
But as you suggest, folks should keep in mind that well above 90% of our revenues are not associated with sales that decoupled. And so we have on the distribution side, and certainly, the transmission revenues are not association -- not associated with sales volumes.

And that is not final rule yet and there will be -- comments will be complete in about 50 days. And after that, the HHS has time to put the rule in place. So based on what we know and interpreted from the executive order, we have a 3-phase investment here. We have an investment where we can supply the market with the growth that is projected in the beginning because it's the progressive -- remember, this addresses the best market about 50% of the overall served market. And then from that 50%, there is a ramp. There is a period where clinics are given an opportunity to change their patterns between clinic hemodialysis and home therapy. So based on that, we can accommodate with some supply chain that we did extremely well about 1.5 years ago by relocating and reregistering products from all over the Americas. So we can do that. 
Then there is a second phase where we do a small investment, more modest than $500 million that give us incremental capacities all the way then to start investing into a new plant. The investment will be -- depends upon the time, sometimes concurrently done. But the effect of the throughput will be felt later -- in later years. Remember, this is a 7-year program. So we feel, as a company, our responsibility, more responsibility to our customers and more so to the patients, is to be there for this opportunity.

And again I would, in that area in particular, given the robustness of demand for that product prior year, believe that, that was principally an execution issue and kind of wrapped up in some of the changes that Glen talked about. So when we talk about acute, it really was overall volume of SCM deals, but also these ancillary products, many of which have pretty immediate revenue conversion, that impacted our top line and bottom line.",-2

And the DRI plant in Louisiana, just to set everyone's mind at ease, that has been running very, very well. There's not been an issue with our operations there. The issue on performance is the fact that we sell our DRI to our own mills at what the pig iron pricing is. Pig iron pricing has been coming down, so of course, our selling price for the DRI, adjusted for value and use, must be going down also. So that's been the biggest impact in the first half. We did have a short outage, I think it was about 12 days, where we had a valve fail. It was not a major issue. We did not have to take it offline and do all the things that we do to cause weeks out of service. We did have a small outage of about 12 days, but that was not a significant impact. It was basically the fact that pig iron pricing is going down, so DRI pricing is going down. Now that's bad news on our DRI side, but bear in mind that we produce about 3.5 million tons of DRI. We buy about 3.5 million to 4 million tons of pig iron. So what we lose on the bananas, we kind of make up on the tomatoes a little bit. So it's a nice hedging situation where we do lose it on the DRI, but it's nice to get the better price on the pig iron. 
But one more point, you did mention the second half and I do want to give everyone an update on that. We did mention that there will be a 60-day outage. It is going to be -- we're going to be down probably towards the end of August, middle to end of August and we'll be down for 60 days. It's going to make major repairs to our furnace vessel, to the control systems and to the refractory to deal with the reliability issues that we've had in the past in those areas. And there's one more major work that we have to do, which will be towards the -- probably early next year and that would be on the material handling side. But right now, it's the -- as you know, the big problem that we've always had was with the process gas heater and that's the major repair that we're making. A second issue we've had in the past, probably the #2 issue with reliability, was on refractory and we'll also going to be doing that during the 60-day outage. And at the beginning of next year, we will not have a major impact to the operation, but we will be doing another large project on our material handling side to improve efficiencies.",-2

It's really -- what predicates performance going forward, we feel, is the -- again more in the markets and what that provides is in the Industrial segment, how we improve our performance for customers and can we take additional position and share in that space. And then in Food and Beverage, this -- the bit of the same applies for components and aftermarket business continue to service customers well and the systems business, I think, we look forward to opportunities where we continue to be selectively -- selective on liquid opportunities. So that playbook is not changing.

Yes, we're protecting a more narrow spread in '19 than we saw in '18. And some of the factors of what you said was Shin Oak coming on could have some downward or squeezing pressure between Conway and Belvieu. It just depends on how much purity products they can move out of the Conway market into Belvieu. In terms of -- as we go forward past 2019, as we've said, Arbuckle II when it comes online, it will open up a lot of purity capacity on our system, on the Sterling system, that presently is being used for raw feed, which we think will bring the spreads back into more of a historical or normal level, a very narrow differential between the 2 markets. So any additional capacity that's put in service between Conway and Belvieu past Arbuckle II, we really won't think we'll have a very limited impact on the spreads from where they are at that time. I'd also say on this, you're talking about a third-party pipeline, what I would say is, we do not anticipate a material change in third-party volume that we currently fractionate and exchange in Mid-Continent that comes off of OPPL for many years in the future. So with that -- but I also say that we do anticipate volume growth from Williams acquisition of Discovery created a need for additional capacity on OPPL. In this regard, we were able to reach an agreement with Williams to accommodate this potential growth in terms that are favorable to us. Also, remember that we received an immediate EBITDA uplift from both shipping our barrels on our own -- 100% owned pipeline and from the additional third-party volume shipped on OPPL.

I'll take the second one first, and then I'll hand to Jim maybe to talk a little bit about AirMini and how we're looking at segmenting the cash-pay market and working with our provider customers. And the second part first. Tom Price was a congressman from Georgia who spoke at the MedTrade conference in Atlanta last fall. And I don't think anyone in the room knew or thought that he might become HHS Secretary. But when he got up on the floor and made a very passionate speech about the importance of homecare, the importance of keeping patients out of hospital, taken well care of in the home, he's an orthopedic surgeon, I think he understands the economics of the broken sort of sick care system where patients are frequent flyers in the ICU and CCU with COPD. And we believe also sleep apnea has a big impact on that. I think he will be a big supporter, and if he puts in place some of the policies that he was advocating for on behalf of the homecare industry as HHS Secretary, we think it could be beneficial for our industry. But look, as Dave said earlier, there's a lot of things going on in Washington right now, a lot of change, and we're going to wait and be ready to hopefully see some more homecare-friendly policies out of Washington, but we'll wait till we see them and then we'll act on them.

But more broadly, it is very clear in the marketplace through whether you look at governmental-led pilots through the Medicare alliance whether you look at through the successful value-based care relationships that exist or whether you look at it in terms of the evolving demand of employer clients from a more integrated approach, which is not a cross-sold or a bundled approach but a more integrated approach that addresses the whole person, understands the need of the whole person and connect the mind and body, the behavior, the lifestyle, the clinical and partner up with the health care professional, that is a more winning proposition day in, day out, that yields a better cost outcome but it's a better cost outcome from a better quality outcome. So I'd say a more consistent mantra relative to that in the marketplace. As it relates to ASO, there's been a consistent trend for years now as it relates to the marketplace, embracing more transparency and demanding more transparency through a variety of lenses and ASO is a mechanism to do so. And as you know from prior conversations, one of the reasons why we've been so passionate about ASO is transparency presents an opportunity for alignment, alignment presents an opportunity for speed of shared execution, which is what's necessary. So those trends are consistent but just to amplify it, yet again, integration is different than bundling or cross-selling, it's truly integrating around the whole person, the information flows, the incentive, the benefit designs with the clinicians and we see that continuing to grow, and we're well positioned there.",1

Just to remind everybody, it is still our fastest-growing business area, still most profitable business area. But going around the horn, and it's a little bit of what I talked about in the first quarter, our biggest concern from a COVID impact standpoint was clearly at Aeronautics. And clearly, the main driver -- main concern at Aeronautics was F-35. And we've done a good job of anticipating that in the quarter and hence, the results you saw in the quarter.
We had really strong results at Missiles and Fire Control in the second quarter, frankly, in the first half. You're right. If you look at where we're going, we're holding guidance. We do see COVID impacts. This is a very high-volume business. So we are starting to see some pressures on Hellfire deliveries and ATACM deliveries regarding -- mainly driven by COVID. But we're going to be up year-over-year mid-single-digit from a growth standpoint in the second half. So still pleased with the trajectory of where the business is going.
Let's see, your second question on guidance for F-35. Yes, second quarter, we saw strong growth across F-35. Follow-on modernization, we received some awards in the quarter. That resulted in strong sales growth year-over-year. In fact, we'll see that into the second half of the year. Production, if you recall, we had a little bit of a slow start in the first quarter, and that was basically timing of supplier payments to us that picked up in the second quarter, but really strong production growth in the second quarter and sustainment is up as well. And so for the year, we're looking at double-digit growth for F-35. Overall, we're seeing development up really strong; sustainment, really strong; and production, mid-single digits, which is higher than what we thought.",2

And when you look at best practices about what they're doing in Europe, what we're doing in the United States, I don't see synergies between our 2 companies. We're here in the Americas and they're across Europe. But when you start to take a look at things like A320 operations and the family of aircraft, maintenance, how they're operating them, their interest in winglets, by the way, as I hope that Airbus is listening to the call or looking at the transcript about the retrofit opportunities. It's that kind of thing. When you look at ancillary revenue opportunities -- by the way, this isn't the first visit that our team has done with other carriers across the world. There's a lot of interest in JetBlue with what we've been doing over the course of the past 12 years, now in our 13th year. And I'll tell you, we're always interested.

So that's likely the indication, and I'm not sure that is a big commercial bearing because most patients who've had -- our chronic migrainers or episodic migrainers have tried many other things. So I think the pool of available patients for prevention will be there. The data in our program, I mean, I believe all the competitors is on 2 failures.

I'll answer that, hopefully, it's what you're getting at. We are going to impose social distancing requirements, specifically around the number of people in the store at one time. So the vast majority of the stores that will not affect our customers because we typically don't have more than the 10 that is recommended, but there will be some stores where we will have to ask customers to wait outside as other customers finish their shop. And we are going to do that and implement that. We're obviously implementing gloves and masks as well as increased cleaning practices. At this point in time, we feel that our store footprint is much better suited to operate in this new environment than other stores that have large mass traffic, and it's very difficult to control customer entry and exit from the store.

In fact, I was blown away by my visit to China at the level of interest and enthusiasm for Tesla and the amount of goodwill that I encountered from people at all levels, from the government, from people in the industry and consumers in general, and I'm really optimistic for how things will go there. We are trying to expand our service centers and Supercharger coverage as fast as possible in China. It's not to generate sales. It's in order to be able to deal with the cars that we deliver in market. So we're really doing very few stores in China. Just our focus is 90%-plus on service centers and Superchargers, and then I think we'll actually have to limit the amount of cars we send to China. Otherwise, it would starve the rest-of-world production. So I mean, that's really how we view things there. I did mention that we elected to do local vehicle production in China in 3 or 4 years, although I should mention the goodwill existed before I said that. It wasn't -- goodwill wasn't a function of that. But that will be for vehicles delivered to the local market in China, and that's to some surrounding countries. And actually, just to be clear, that wouldn't mean shifting any production from California. That would be assuming that California's starting to reach its next production. It makes sense for us to start looking at local country factories, and we would be looking at one in Europe as well just to -- I mean, these really end up minimizing the logistics costs, because shipping 2 tons of metal over long distances is not very efficient. So it's just the sensible thing to do is to try to satisfy local demand with local production over time.",2
197919,14958825,304446,61243,Kohl's Corporation,"Well, I guess from my perspective, you're also starting to see cost reduction, so units might be up, but costs might be down. So your dollar increase in terms of inventory won't be as great. We look at it more on an inventory per store basis versus a overall inventory. So our inventory was up 3.7%. I would expect at the end of the second quarter for it to be somewhere in the mid to high single digits on a per store basis. That will give us enough units we think to do much better. You got to remember last year, we were down significantly in inventory. So if you go back to 2010, we're probably sort of flattish. And it's not going to be across the board. There are certain areas we're going to be investing in like kids definitely reacted very well to price reductions we took in the first quarter. We're going to be very aggressive for Back-to-School on that from a unit perspective. Obviously, that's a big season for the kids business and areas like Missy's updated and contemporary, we need more units. Classic inventories on the Missy side, we won't be as aggressive in. That business is coming back a little bit. It's probably the best quarter we've had in close to 2 years on Missy's classic, but you're not going to see the kind of unit growth in that area that you will on the other 2 I mentioned. So we're trying to be smart about it. It's not going to be across the board, and we're certainly cognizant of the fact that it's a little bit bigger unit increase than we have had in the past, but we're still trying to normalize where we think demand is. Private brands definitely were hurt by the lack of units. We started March in a pretty good shape and then when it got hot, those 2 weeks in the cold-weather regions, we blew through serious amount of units in 2 weeks. And that really dampened our April sales. Most of our seasonal categories for the month of April were down at least 20%.",-2

We certainly haven’t seen a change due to that and it’s too early to see any change in the merchandise. So at this point we’re not changing our expectations based on that. I would expect the consumer to have a little bit more money in their pocketbook, but I’m not sure they’re driving practices are going to fundamentally change.

And then the second thing is that we also get growth through the, I'll say, success and growth of our clients.

1369191,76119274,1936461,313055,Walmart Inc.,"Yes. Let me take the first question on pickup. And I believe the question was, when you look across the operation that we have, which is don't charge, and we're able to fulfill customers' basket today, what happens if others do it?

But -- and the reason I think the growth is it's about the customer. People are busier than they've ever been.

Nor are we looking to run the construction labor materials and other costs related to construction through our books. So Shah Deniz, in the scope that we are anticipating, would be a very large dollar award with a more traditional oil and gas margin associated with it as opposed to a bigger revenue base, but a smaller margin that you'd see on an EPC.

And I recognize our consolidated operations in China are complicated because we have the Lincoln-imported products, some of the Ford-imported products. We also have the cost structure of Ford-owned entities and employees in China. And then we have our allocations that from the corporation and from engineering, et cetera, are in the consolidated numbers. So it's a compilation of a lot of things. Suffice to say, we don't believe in exporting vehicles at a contribution margin loss as long as we don't have a spike of import duties that are a near-term issue.
The solution to this largely is around localization plans for our business in China. We've been very public about we have 5 more vehicles being planned to be locally assembled in the near term. That includes the Lincoln, Corsair and the Ford Explorer. So we have a number of products that are going to be localized over the next year, 1.5 years, which will really influence this and will help us be more competitive cost-wise in the business in China but also will take away some of the exposure we've had to some of the fluctuations in tariff, so we feel good about that plan.
As you know and you noted, the Lincoln plan has been an import plan until now when we started localizing Lincoln Corsair and then more to come from there, which will really help with this. So they're contribution margin positive. There's a lot of costs in that consolidated business, but this will largely get taken care of by the localization plans we have going forward.",-2

188217,14647481,297227,35650,"Tower International, Inc.","Yes, happy to do that, Adam. I mean, it was prompted, there were a number of changes underway. And I'll go through, for those who didn't pick up our announcement earlier this week, I'll cover other aspects of it. Our President of the International Operations, Gyula Meleghy, was looking to retire. And that happened. In fact, it happened effective April 30. For background for those who haven't been around Tower for very long, it actually was Meleghy Corporation, his dad's business that he founded, that was acquired by Tower in the past. So he's had a long history with us, about 30 years between that company and the time with Tower. It wouldn't surprise me to see Gyula end up back in a more entrepreneurial role somewhere, and we wish him well. With changes that have taken place, we've gone from -- over these past 5 years, gone from taking disparate organizations that we instill best practices in. Now we've gone past that, we've got those best practices in and we've run the company at the same way in all the regions. And now what's happened is the economies have morphed. As we know, China is going in a different direction than Europe, for example. And so that construct that we had, originally coming out with a head of all the international operations, needed to evolve and get much more regionally specific. A gentleman by the name of Par Malmhagen will be coming to us at the beginning of June from Autoliv. Rather than repeat his very terrific credentials, you can see them in our press release. He's a very well-rounded, very knowledgeable person and accomplished in the automotive space and in Europe, in particular. China is a big deal to us. And my view on this, I hope you share it, a real competent CFO should be ingrained in the business. Jim certainly qualifies in terms of that confidence. And frankly, for China right now, there's a lot of capital movement. He's naturally involved in that aspect anyway. And the best way to understand where the cash is involved is to be involved in it. I think the moves specifically in China shows the attention we're putting in China and how much we're investing there. I think it's good for Tower, and frankly, I think it's good for Jim.",1

So our pipeline is large enough that when we acquired Intersys, while we wanted them to deliver on their legacy accounts, if you will, we needed to cross-purpose them. So we have -- if I -- we don't report this number, but the amount of pursuits we're doing jointly now is astronomical, considering we've only been at this for 2 months, 2.5 months. We are really leveraging them across our entire client base, to the point we're probably wearing them thin. And so we have to watch that. But we're certainly picking and choosing areas. And I think, we are focused on trying to get at that larger pipeline, as opposed to just delivering on Intersys' legacy accounts. And this was important, obviously. Okay?",2

Clearly, on the yield side, as we initiated some of the pricing initiatives last year that was able to help us offset the growth of the direct auto business, which, as you know, is lower price, but also has lower losses and greater operating leverage. So I think the combination of yields and charge-offs are kind of getting to the hard work from the organization over the last couple of years as we've grown the book, as Jay mentioned, from, when we came together as a combined company, it was about 70% unsecured, and we've been able to get that down to kind of below around 57% as of the end of the quarter. So as that trend continues and stabilizing yields will give you a better risk-adjusted margin. At the same time, we've been able to drive down the operating expenses. So you've been able to kind of continue to do that. And given the growth rates that we put out there, even with operating expenses, as I mentioned, the steady state is not going to be the 5%, that's a little bit of the investment we have, we will continue to drive both financial leverage as well as operating leverage in the business.",1

They're focused, first and foremost, on growing the network and growing engagement and daily utility on Cash App, and we believe and we've seen that lead to monetization. And Cash App has scaled from negligible revenues 3 years ago to now an annualized rate of over $0.5 billion in revenues. So we can unpack that a little bit for you.  
I think you're asking specifically about how the opportunities with Cash Card and the ability to grow that attach rate in those revenues associated with Cash Card over time. Maybe if you take it back one step and look at overall monetization for Cash App, 2 years ago, when we were very early in the life of monetization of Cash App, we disclosed, I think, this is in the second quarter of 2017, that over 1/3 of users monetized. And that was pre-Cash Card. Now we've seen significant growth in that number with the addition of these new monetization and engagement levers like Cash Card, like Bitcoin and a number of other levers.  
With Cash Card, in particular, we disclosed the 3.5 million actives. We continue to see growing attach rate for Cash Card from period to period, and we think we're in the early days of that. We're also seeing really strong metrics around usage and engagement with multiple transactions in a given week for everyday purchases. So this is a really great proof point for us around customer engagement and driving retention and opportunities for cross-sell into this large and growing audience into the future.
In terms of just -- I think the last part of your question was around breaking down revenues for Cash App. We have half a dozen revenue streams and we believe that we are in the very early days of that. The 2 biggest are around Instant Deposit and Cash Card, and we've got 4 other growing revenue streams. And given we're in the early days and this team has demonstrated strong product velocity, we envision many more into the future.",3

So just to reiterate that last point that Randy made. Look, the reality is, the marketplace is evolving in the way that these larger-scale, more professional growers are going to get their products, it's going to continue to evolve as well. But my hope and our hope here and what we've been working hard with, with our retail partners is to help the retail evolve along with us and the grower. In the future, I think there's definitely a place for retail but just like the rest of us, retail is going to have to evolve along with the rest of the marketplace.

520173,37301948,867860,347306,"Extended Stay America, Inc.","Sure. First, I would comment on costs. We are really holding the line on costs rather than doing any deliberate cost cutting and -- but it does speak to the power of the business model and the fact that we are generating revenue growth really through big [ph] entirely that we're able to flow-through pretty high levels of additional revenue to hotel operating profit. In fact, in our guidance for the third quarter contemplates over 90% of incremental revenue flowing to hotel operating profit. On the revenue side, you correctly note that we are going to experience more displacement due to renovations in the third quarter than last year. In fact, it's probably going to affect our growth rate by 70 to 80 basis points in the third quarter. We, in the past, have been reluctant to renovate in the third quarter because of the level of business. But we're in a different spot now. We have, as you mentioned, greater confidence in revenue management and our demand generators and sales. And also, we think that it makes a lot of sense for our shareholders to complete our renovations as quickly as possible given the results that we've seen. So we're going to press ahead and renovate hotels in the third quarter and it will impact revenue. But we have maintained our revenue guidance of about 5% to 7% RevPAR growth for the third quarter in spite of that. And yes, that comes out of more or improved demand generation and our conversion out of our call center, which by the way was up 60% in terms of revenue booked through the call center in the second quarter. The call center is working very effectively and so we think that we're still comfortable with that revenue guidance in spite of the -- this increased displacement that we'll see.",2

I think Duncan Dale, who leads that operation for us, is I would not say disappointed by any means, he's quite happy to be in the market. But he certainly sees the softness of the market and is being very selective in what he is writing, and would like to be able to see opportunities that were at higher relative price level.

The other one was the base epoxy, and that also is driven by turnarounds that occur in one quarter versus another quarter. So that was a significant driver there.

And we saw the benefit of that for the full year of 2016. It doesn't take as long to determine if freight is working for you or it's not working for you. We immediately run all new business through dimensioners. We're capturing that information and we have a very quick view and understanding of our mix. So I think that's the piece that's important here and that's also why I say with an increased weight per shipment and a decreasing length of haul, those things aren't necessarily bad. But certainly we need to be positive on the yield side. But I don't have to have this big whipsaw effect in yield versus volume. I think with all the intelligence we have now from the dimensioners, it's the process becomes more exact.",1

Bob, I'm going to pick up half of the answer here, and I'm going to pass to Brik to get a little bit more color on the question on the share. First of all, there were shifts in the market because us not having Mini-Bags and Mini-Bag Plus and amino assets. We actually were the ones teaching our customers how to use alternative methods. Some of them will come back, and we expect in 2019 to pick up a portion of that without a problem. The other ones will take a little longer for us to convert because those are medical practices. You have a significant amount of hospitals in the country, and we have large market share. I would say that we don't see the issues that we experienced in '18 by rebasing '18 to affect tremendously growth rates going forward. So as a matter of fact, I would say 
that the full year of 2018 results are the base for the LRP that we presented in May, which runs from 18 to 23. So using the projected performance of 2018 we -- that we just shared with you, we are not revising our long-term guidance for total Baxter even the top or bottom lines. So there are structural issues. They take a little longer to resolve, but we have not lost any customers at this moment. And we may have lost some temporary share in accounts where some fluids are being substituted, which we expect from the mid- to long term to recapture.

So the month is not concluded. But we're seeing improvements as compared to May and June across all the key metrics. So unrated is a little bit better. Visitation is better and the spend per visit is stable versus what we saw in the latter half of Q2. With regards to driving incremental visitation, it's one -- one of our missions is to increase our rated play percentage. We're still at only 2/3 of our database. It's a lot better than where we were 2, 3 years ago at 60%, but we want to get that up to 70%, 75%.

Now these cars were precisely designed to safely transport Bakken crude grades. And as such, they're equipped with enhanced features and include thicker steel, double-hull bottom, half-head shields, top fittings protection and a reclosing pressure relief device. So they're truly state-of-the-art railcars. Our experience is that rail company operators are equally focused on safety, just as we are.

We're comfortable with where we're at. What's really happening is it's much easier to procure those certified and late model vehicles. And a lot of our stores, it is the path of least resistance to find those cars. We do believe that there is some training and some opportunities in really staying focused on that core product. And if you remember that core products have 3- to 8-year-old vehicle, if you look at the bucket of 3- to 8-year-old vehicles or that 6 years of vehicle, about half of those years are sub 14 million SAAR years. So they are difficult cars to find, it's something that we've known. But also now with an increasing SAAR in current vintages, that is easier to find those cars and people are trading them in and they take dollars. So it's quite a balance to be able to keep our teams and our General Manager are pretty attentive on helping their used car people and managers, divest those cars that are late-model and continue to try to find those core products. So I think as we move forward, we'll be dropping off a 10 million, 8 million SAAR and a 12 million, 2 million SAAR something like that, that are really those 8- and 7-year-old vehicles right now.

And I can assure you that senior management and our board are frequently evaluating our capital allocation and as part of that buybacks and dividends.

But I think we said from the outset, and we were very clear that the priority of the first 24 months was to put our money to work to grow the business. It was the main driver -- the main rationale for spinning out of Hilton was to unlock the value of the business and finally get our hands on our own dedicated capital. And we knew there is opportunities out there to accelerate the business, and we're a little slow out of the gate. First year, we put $45 million to work, but we're really pleased with what we've been able to accomplish this year, with these amazing assets and the fact that we've remain very capital efficient and the structure. So I'm convinced we've made the right move, and we're going to start seeing the benefits. We've already started to see a little bit this year.

We have had a situation in Brazil where ethanol has actually -- production of ethanol has been reduced in favor of more sugar production.

It will take most of this year of -- -- excuse me, 2019, to get it ready with the engineering and the equipment. We're working on it now. Engineering is done. The equipment is being built. We will be taking a 60-day downturn, sometime towards the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019, we will complete the work upon the material handling side. We will complete the work in the process gas heater. Our objective, our intention is to come up after that. We think we'll be much more reliable.

790568,50601618,1248768,27862,eBay Inc.,"Yes, I mean, the first party -- we're not going to breakout Korea first party. It's not, in the greater scheme of things, a massive contributor on dollars. On a year-over-year basis, it's been growing nicely and does impact gross margins and that's why we've called it out. With respect to margins, a couple of things. As I called out, foreign exchange was 180 basis points of the -- was 80 basis points of the 180 versus prior year decline in margins. The rest of the decline was really driven by investments in and the integration of Ticketbis. And so at a broad level, if you want to call that unusual, that's a year-over-year change that's driving most of it. But similar to the last couple of years, we've offset many of the investments that we've been making to accelerate growth via leverage/productivity. And so I feel like, as we look at the first half of the year, there's always unusuals. We've called out Ticketbis in this case. But the fact of the matter is, I think, we've done a reasonably good job of operationally trading off the investments with productivity, recognizing that we do have that Ticketbis acquisition and foreign exchange. Maybe a bit more dynamic -- and get to your other question about foreign exchange, if you look at the last 2 years, those dynamics aren't that dissimilar with the ad that I would put in here, which is we had a standup cost in the first year of separation. And so again, a little bit of an unusual as we stood the company up as a standalone entity. As we look at year-to-year, we're able to offset much of the foreign exchange impact, the gains that were recorded historically below line and now that will be in revenue, as I called out in my remarks. But over time, a stronger U.S. dollar will pressure our margin rate and over time a weaker will help. But it's going to be muted on both sides, if not eliminated, with our hedging programs.",1

224956,16457439,339846,666631,Allegiant Travel Company,"Sure. First of all, let me go back to the last question. Let me add one more thing about the monthly RASM performance we forecast. I think that the capacity growth that we showed throughout the quarter also mirrors the results we expect. So the growth in August is greater than July, the growth in September is greater than August. And part of that is just due to the really tight capacity that we had last year during that same period, and we feel really good about the capacity plan for the quarter, I might add. So anyway, as far as your other question. Yes, I think that there is just -- we fought this issue when we went public about this really factually incorrect and empirically proved to be incorrect notion that somehow in a recessionary environment, leisure is where you don't want to be. We think the facts are clear and they stayed exactly the opposite. And so we're just trying to, I guess, take the opportunity to remind investors that, I mean, I guess, maybe the next time around, it may be different. But we see no reason to believe that it would be. We performed extremely well during the downturn environment and if we do end up seeing one, then I think we expect that the history will repeat itself. That being said, no, we don't see any trends that are alarming in any way. When we try to strip out the capacity adjustments we have in August and September, which are pretty substantial on a year-over-year basis. And then we try to see, okay, are we doing what you would expect on a seasonal basis. Obviously, back half of August, September are 2 of the weaker -- or it's one of the weaker periods during the year. And as we look at that, what we see is maybe something that's slightly below normal seasonal patterns but ever so slight and we don't see any real -- we don't see any change in the trend line or anything like that, John, but obviously, we're keeping our eye on the macro environment. And at this point, I think that -- maybe the best way to put it is our capacity plans remain intact nd at this point, we're not looking in any way of changing that. And of course if we see a reason to do so, we will. But at this point in time, we're very comfortable with what we have on the books in terms of our capacity in the back half of the year.",-2

But like, if I use the analogy of a fine sports car, when you drive if off the lot with 10 miles on the odometer, you're cautioned to warm up that engine or to bring that engine up to speed slowly. So we're going to continue over the next few weeks to work through these commissioning and test the limits of the equipment in a very controlled way.

That translates in dollars, $48 million uncollected in the quarter, of which we deferred $21 million. We also abated $3 million, and we set up reserves for $9 million as uncollectible. That $12 million reduces FFO and FFO as adjusted and cash basis NOI and all the other metrics. We also went on a cash basis for revenue recognition to 56% or almost $9 million of all of the monthly rent not collected through the writing off of the $36 million of straight line rents, which has the effect of putting those tenants on a cash basis. So going forward, more than half of all the rents not collected in the second quarter are now on a cash basis. While COVID-19 has given rise to a much higher level of rents not collected that were used to, it's still relatively small on a company our size with $1.7 billion of annual rents and additional revenues coming from hotels and BMS, et cetera, et cetera.

1435277,78568760,2007127,18671,Albemarle Corporation,"Yes. So we entered the year, as you know, with our capacity fully committed and under contract, 90% plus of our battery-grade materials are under contract. And as we go through this year, we obviously have the uncertainty associated with what might happen in the second half. But our intent is to keep our plants running, to keep our customers supplied. We are seeing some indications that they -- from a few customers that they're going to want to reduce their forecast. Those will be commercial discussions we have with them. 
There are other opportunities we have to place that volume if we have to, but our intent is to -- and our hope is our customers want our contracts. So at the moment, we don't -- we're operating on a place-the-volume-per-plan mode. There are -- or is a playbook we have that in the event there is a worst-case sort of recession coming, there certainly is a playbook we have around what we need to do, around how we'd run our plants. But we do not have any -- well, beyond what we've already announced, have further intent to close any plants at this point in time until we see how the second half demand plays out. I think that was your first question.
Second question was inventory, correct, Kendall? So inventory has been drawn down to some extent with customers we serve. We know that because they've reduced their volumes in the first half as expected. The challenge we have is not knowing what's happening else -- of course, China had a very weak first quarter itself because of the pandemic. Now automotive plants in Europe and the U.S. have been -- are closing, which, as I said earlier, could have a third quarter impact. And there's been numerous supply disruptions amongst our competitors, some of which is related to COVID-19 and some of which, frankly, has been related to their own liquidity challenges. 
So when you put all that together, it's very hard for me to comment on what inventory looks like and how much it has been drawn down across the channel -- across the whole industry. So I'll just have to sort of let you know as we go through. Maybe next quarter or 2, we'll get better clarity on that. But right now, it's quite muddy.",-3

But I -- yes, I can confirm that, as they've already confirmed, that they're moving towards DCT. And frankly speaking, it's not a surprise. As I put in my comments this morning, Changan has launched its DCT with BorgWarner content. And we'll see more acceleration and adoption of DCT in China.

717446,47021999,1134257,29470,Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.,"Yes. The overall trends, it remains pretty good. We ended up for the year last year in the mid-single digits in same-store growth. I think we're thinking similar this year, maybe a tick below as they continue to transition their economy, but still feel like we're going to have pretty decent positive same-store growth this year in China. On the new unit side, we continue to pick up steam. We opened 20% more hotels -- hotel rooms in '16 than we did in '15. We think we'll be another 10% or 20% and then again higher in terms of our NUG, net unit growth, on a rooms basis in '17 over '16. And so we're making good headway. I think that the pivot we made a few years ago was a really important pivot. We've talked about it for a few years. We anticipated it ahead of, I think, a lot of others. And that was that in the end a lot of the growth, like most markets around the world, as they start to become a little bit more mature as a hotel market comes into mid-market because that's where you have the middle class population growth that is at a very high rate. The mid-market product is what they can afford, and that ultimately ends up driving a lot of the growth. So as we've -- it has been well chronicled, we pivoted very hard about 3 years ago to start to build out our infrastructure, retool our products on both Garden Inn and Hampton, including doing the joint venture with Plateno in anticipation of that, and that's exactly what's happening. So every year that's gone by over the last bunch of years, we've seen more unit growth for our brands in that market. The composition of that unit growth has changed dramatically. We're now net -- if you look at next year, meaning this year, you will see the majority or at least probably 50-50 of our openings will be between focused service and full service and above, where it used to be essentially 100% full service and above. So that pivot's been incredibly important and, I think, impactful as an enabler to continue to keep our growth moving in a very positive direction there.",2

And as you stated, we don't think that this work will necessarily ever be done. It doesn't have an endpoint. It's one of those things, like security or privacy, where your comps have to evolve and comps have to stay 10 steps ahead as you learn the dynamics of the network and get better and better. We've made some really meaningful progress and definitely moving faster than our expectations, but there's still a lot ahead. We made a major shift this year in shifting more of our model and our enforcement towards behavior and conduct on the network rather than content. That is entirely machine learning and deep learning driven. And that should give us an ability to move much, much faster at scale. We're starting to really get a discipline around integrating this into how we think about all of our work. So as we thought about building the events experience and deploying it to the World Cup, health was a big factor of this. So it's becoming more and more of our DNA and something that the teams are asking the right questions to start any particular project. So as that develops over time, I do believe that we can move in a much more rapid pace. And we're doing a bunch of moves right now that are more coarse-grained to address and acknowledge a bunch of the things that we've seen for quite some time but weren't able to fully meet. But then it will be steady state, and we'll continue to push that work as fast as possible. But I am seeing a really good discipline, and the pace of innovation continues to rise.",2

I think if you look at the industry ARC data for December, sort of industry revenue for December for domestic actually is looking a little bit soft. It's definitely in a different trajectory than October and November are, and we watch this for a little while. Now at the same time, over last 3 -- certainly, September, October, as we've said, we have seen close-in strength. So from our perspective, I think it's a little bit early to call it.

We're not new to international. We've been in Brazil and Argentina for a good 14 years. We've been in Poland for almost 14 years as well. So in those cases, I think our original strategy was let's find a good partner, let's find someone who could use our technology and our operational excellence because I think you really do have to be knowledgeable how these markets work. And that's going well for us. I think India is another one of those places. I think there is huge opportunity over the long-term here. It's obviously an economy that you can't ignore. And it's obviously, a country that has proven to be fairly difficult for people to do business in. And that's why, I feel so strongly that our selection of a partner was a key factor here. I think we went to kind of, gone in there just kind of saying let's be there and let's go, unless we had someone who would help navigate. In the Pai family [indiscernible] Pai, who runs that part of the company is really a talented entrepreneur. And so we're going in there. We're giving him some capital he needs to continue his growth and together, I think we're going to learn a lot because not only are we going to learn about the market but we're also going to learn some of the product lines that he's in, and figure out how else can we leverage that. So I think we'll continue to look internationally as a place for opportunity and I think we like to see places where there's going to be demand for marketing. And that really implies that you got fast-growing middle classes and countries that are sort of coming into their own. So again, we don't do any of this on a whim. India wasn't sort of decided upon in 2 months. It was a relationship I've built for over 5 years and I feel good about where we're going. We're not making such a big bet there that it has any impact negatively on us. I think it's only positive that we're going to see there.

And that's for sure helped us improve our service to our customers as we've had almost 50% reduction in out of stocks compared to the last year.

So year-to-date, our trading day adjusted domestic STRs are down about 2.3, and our domestic STWs are down 3.8. And on a full year basis, we would anticipate that these numbers would converge as we expect distributed inventories to -- compared to the prior year increase a little bit by a day or 2 in support of the go live of our Golden system ordering tool early next year.

I think the portfolio -- sorry, the pipeline right now is I would sort of describe it as healthy and sort of typical with where we are in the year. There is no question that our performance this year, both on the commitment side and on the funding side, is partially driven by some of the things that we've done that you mentioned. We've done a couple of things from a product perspective, we've done a couple of things from a strategic perspective that we believe have helped us capture some additional market share. We also think that there's a lot more room for growth with respect to those things and some other things that the team and I are actively working on currently. 
If you look at the commitment numbers on a year to date basis as we mentioned, you're essentially at $1.4 billion when you include what we've already done in the month of October alone. 2018 was a record year for us where we delivered $1.2 billion in commitments. Through 10 months, we're already at $1.4 billion. So I can't tell you exactly what percent or what dollar amount is directly attributable to those things, but we are certainly of the view that you're seeing a significant impact from a lot of those that we've been talking about and some of those things that we're continuing to work on that we hope to roll out over the next several quarters.",2

So really, our focus is how do we continue to execute the way we have been executing, continue to launch innovative product to get into more categories.

1427024,78516238,2005647,909408,The Western Union Company,"Yes, I think that's a great question. If you look at -- let me start where we see first decline, where it started. It has, obviously, to do with lockdowns. It's subject to lockdown orders by governments and especially on our dedicated locations. There were shelter-in-place orders. Obviously, people couldn't go on to a retailer to make a transaction. That impacted. But we believe that also the financial pressure is probably the main one which has a factor to our decline. And that -- combined with that, so we saw, in late March, the significant decline in our transactions.
So if you look at then the time -- over time as the lockdown gets and the stimulus packages get in the U.S., but mainly Germany, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland, we see improvements there. And as the people could get their stimulus package and they get economical more advanced, they send it -- they start to send money. And at the same time, also some Mexico peso weakness versus U.S. We saw also stronger growth there. And coming back on the Mexico pesos weakness helped us to send money to Mexico from the U.S., the corridor.
In fact, Banco de Mexico, Raj, I believe yesterday they gave the numbers, the monthly numbers, and we can see that we are gaining market share there also in Mexico.",-2

In fact, early this morning, I added to my notes that I was going to say that earlier, actually, what we've done with COVID in many respects -- closer to communities and governments. I recall going into February, going into March, when we started working remotely, Kathleen and I were looking at each other and say, ""Okay, now what are we going to do?"" And by April, we had a plan. Well, that's the situation for all these communities and all these governments, and people are still struggling with that. And so by our being aggressive in investing in health care protocols, testing equipment, and doing things to help these communities, in Indonesia, I mean, we have 2 PCR labs. Here in the United States, was it taken often? A week to 2 weeks to get PCR results? Well, we have 2 PCR labs: 1 in lowlands, 1 in highlands, which we're working with the community to use, and that's much appreciated. We help build an oxygen facility for Arequipa. 
So by showing that we are competent in managing these, by showing we have sensitivities to workers, families and the communities, by working with governments to do that, we're showing both competency, sensitivity and the fact that we are committed to being good partners, so I think all of that's going to be beneficial. We've achieved that in steps. We moved our headquarters to Arizona several years ago, we made a big commitment to show people of Arizona that we could be good partners. And now we are widely regarded as being great partners. So that's an excellent point. And ESG matters are of growing importance and significance to investors. We know that. We believe that's a good trend, and we will measure up well by that because that's just what our commitment is.",1

If you look at, as I said, pharma had a tough comp, but there was a lot of actions in Q1 from customers around inventory, things that they did, and we're starting to see the pickup of that. We saw a few in personal care, a few customers delay orders just because as an example, in the sun care area, it was a softer year for our customers last year, so there was some inventory impact, but we're seeing those orders already coming in now. And for coatings, I think the indication is more -- for us, seasonally, it's more the back half of the year. And indications is that that'll start picking up.

So I can't quantify it is exactly, but -- so when we set up our East and West Coast DCs, we obviously had to set them up in parallel to our existing distribution network. So we're still running, largely, a redundant network in North America. The focus has been primarily on maintaining service levels, making sure that there was no disruption. So the East, West Coast DCs, they're increasing volume more or less every month, but they're still not at full run rate. Once they get at full run rate, it will give us the opportunity to reduce costs and footprint elsewhere. And that, ultimately, will be the biggest driver of the cost savings. I would say we're still sort of in the middle of that right now. I said it would carry into 2017. I'm not sure how far it will carry. It will just depend on how quickly we can execute the whole optimization plan.",1

First of all, our actuals for year-to-date was impacted by the denial of HEP, which cost -- that was an $85 million anticipated purchase equitized at roughly 56%, which we anticipated to be around the timing of the first quarter in our original guidance. So you have that impacted this year, which impacted ROE expectations. Secondly, the $14 million loss on the RAM on an actuals to actual basis, all of which has been incurred now because of that onetime transition. $14 million over our equity invested into the utility will get you -- you can do the math on that. It's just $14 million net income will get you somewhere around 70 to 75 basis point reduction in what we've achieved year-to-date. So you make adjustments for that for the current period. Looking forward, the purpose of slide 2016 -- or the 2016 consolidated ROE lag was to show -- to demonstrate largely what the structural issues are that are embedded in our rate structure generally. And that 50, 60 basis point lag, it tends to be structural and not something that's likely to be recoverable through the rate case cycle. But as you look to the right on that slide, past the structural items, you see -- we demonstrated, if in 2016, had we been able to recover our full cost of service and return on our investments, that would've made 120 basis points differential. Meaning that's the opportunity that we see as we go through our first rate case cycle in 6 years to true-up the decoupling mechanisms and go through a standard rate case cycle. That's the upside. That's the opportunity that we see to improve our performance through a full recovery of our cost of our allowed cost at our allowed rates.",-2

The emerging market -- emerging market segment is not quite that fast but more of those vaults tend to be new. We're waiting on a new vault to be built. So it's kind of a function of what mix hits us in what timing, I'd say, especially in last half of last year we saw an acceleration of that kind of core Europe market and thus, pacing picked up. Yes, I'd say over time, when we kind of look at the numbers, our -- the quarter in Europe was very good constant currency growth of 17%. On the trailing 12 month, constant currency growth's 14%.

And in fact, when you look at the 2 cases highlighted on the slide, Microsoft and State Street, they were U.S. multinationals that expanded with us in EMEA and Asia Pacific.

And so a lot of our investment takes the form in -- of internally developed software and so that's captured in CapEx. And as we had discussed previously, a lot of the acceleration was associated with the ramp-up of Geomni and the purchase of planes and sensors to build scale in that business. And while we continue to invest in that business, it is at a lower level on -- proportionally relative to revenues than it had been in the past. And hopefully, as you saw in this quarter, the capital intensity, in other words, the CapEx as a percentage of revenue, showed a decline relative to that level. And you saw in terms of the absolute growth rate a slower level of growth. And so I think that is one way to think about the level of capital intensity within the business. Beyond that, we have OpEx expenses associated with a number of our breakout initiatives and we expect that to continue to grow as we fund these new breakout initiatives across the business. Some of them are profitable, some of them are at an earlier stage where they may be lower-margin or not profitable yet.

But clearly, the model that we have in Comex, the concessionaire network model, plays very well into Central America, where you have entrepreneurial people that are looking to put extra TVs in their house, go out and buy a car. This model works very well down there, and we're exporting the Comex model into Central America. So that's a real positive for us. We're bringing the PPG products into Comex. That has continued the acceleration of the Comex sales. That's why we're more than 2x GDP. The Comex team continues to perform at a very high level. We've been pleased. We've added over 100 stores in the first half of the year. So we're adding a store every other day. Basically, we anticipate having over 170 stores by the end of the year. So we continue to get more geographic diversity. If you remember when we bought it, we said that we had higher share than normal in the central part and we were underrepresented in the north and the south. We're taking care of that, and so we're growing additional share and presence in both the north and the south. So overall, I couldn't be more pleased with our Comex team.",3

359083,23505430,510061,26949,"Big Lots, Inc.","Sure, Matt. Q2 -- the trends or the trajectory in Q2 was as expected. If you'll recall from the last call, we were concerned about the early trends in May and particularly, the Memorial Day weekend, where, as you'll recall, in most markets, it could have been 15 or 20 degrees cooler than the prior year. Memorial Day weekend is typically a big, big kickoff for us for summer and lawn and garden merchandise, and that business did not happen in May. In June, business got incrementally better, and in July, the comps for the month of July were actually essentially flat. So May comps were below the quarter, June comps were in line with the quarter and the July comps were essentially flat or better than the quarter number, which was very encouraging to us. So we're sitting here at the end of July saying we're right on trajectory to go into the back half of the year. Candidly, the first 2 weeks of August were not as encouraging for us, and comps were down to last year. Now the last week to 10 days, comps are back closer to that flat range. So what you see reflected in our Q3 guidance -- Matt and for others, because I know this is probably a common, common question out there, what you see reflected in our Q2 guidance is us acknowledging that we've got 2 different trend results here in August as we start the quarter. We do understand that as the quarter goes on, obviously, our business got more and more challenged last year, so we understand that there's a little bit lower bar out there. But coming out of second quarter, we felt pretty confident going into the third. And then again, the first 2 weeks of August gave us a little bit of, hopefully, what plays out to be a head fake, but we're really not sure just yet. So again, 90 days ago, we would have been talking about slightly positive comps in the third quarter. We thought it was prudent to adjust our expectations for third quarter and acknowledge that the early start to August and for some back-to-school was not as robust as we would have liked.",-3

The revolving line of credit had a balance of $3.197 billion at the end of June, and the term loan was $1.724 billion. So you're roughly $4.9 billion of floating rate debt. And we are seeing the Fed cutting interest rates, so we are getting a benefit of that today, and that's reflected in our guidance for the other expense that we've guided to the Street. That is the debt that we are paying down though still. We are paying down the variable-rate debt, and when that come down, we should see the benefit in the overall operating results.

And that is a process that's currently under way. 
Last point that I would make, and one of the things that we've learned from how we've had to operate, we've reduced our cost structure. And when you take the VirnetX settlement and when you take out the COVID-19 impacts to the business that are arguably temporary, the business had a 10.9% EBITDA margin in the quarter.

You first asked about second half relative to first half. And we are saying flattish. Probably the biggest driver for us there is we have 5 less working days in the second half of the year. So we run at about $8 million a day, that's about $40 million and so that has some impact for us. I mentioned earlier, we have some larger programs that we'll see adjudicated here second half, which could have an impact, whether they are protested or not protested, would have an impact. So it's a little bit tough to say, even upon a win, can we get anything into the year revenue-wise and at this point the longer -- the later in the year we get the less likely it is that we drive revenue there.",-1

So we thought that and we had -- we thought that this was an appropriate time to actually sit down and put out a framework for what the NAV is. It is merely a calculation of income at a cap rate. So the income is absolutely correct at our number. The cap rate is -- involves some subjective judgment, but you can get pretty close to accuracy, at least we think we can. So the rationale is, is other people do it, our peers do it, our investors and analysts seem to want it and so there you have it.

We're going to a have $408 billion base defense budget, we're going to get a budget on October 1 of '13 for Federal fiscal 2014 and then we're going -- it's going to give us some predictability. Then we went through September 30 and October 1 with the shutdown, a CRA that only goes through January 15 and a federal ceiling limit through February 7. I don't know right now. I just don't know what's going to happen and our customers don't know what's going to happen. They're very cautious. That's the tone, cautious, right now. If they've got $100 to spend or obligate, they're spending or obligating $70 and they're holding $30 in their pocket to see what's going to happen. And that's kind of what we see right now. So right now, Mark, if I had to speculate, I think '14 is going to be choppy on the DoD side, that's 60%, 65% of our business. We're on some great platforms, so our choppiness is banded. There's a band around it, which is very reassuring to us. And that's one of the reasons I went through a lot of those programs today. I wanted to reiterate to people that the programs we're on are fundamental to the national security of the United States. We're not going to be de-orbiting satellites. We're not going to be decommissioning Trident, ballistic missile submarines, thing with product operates etc. within the band is going to move around a little bit, but it's funded, it's going to be solid. And when we get clear of this environment, whenever that this, we're going to be really, really well-positioned.

I think what's happening is, for a long time, Red Hat was in the business of offering lower-cost alternatives to traditional components of the stack, so EAP to replace WebSphere, WebLogic, or RHEL to replace UNIX. And in that world, we were very interesting to people in purchasing or people in infrastructure. But now, with a portfolio that includes a newer set of offerings, and this is as open source, in general, becomes more innovative, so things like a container platform or OpenStack, or as you said, Ansible, which is core to being able to do DevOps, we're now on the CIO's agenda. And so we have many more senior meetings, we are much more involved earlier on when decisions are getting made on architecture because of that, and that provides a tailwind for our business rules management or our messaging all of our other offerings as well. So really, I'd call it we've moved from having a seat at the table at the purchasing department to having a seat at the table with the CIO. And that leads to a lot of benefits as we get a chance to show our portfolio more broadly, and we have this larger portfolio that's more kind of strategic because it is more about innovation.",1

So, the next big hurdle right now is the 80% threshold, which we are focused on.

And then each quarter, new acquisitions coming in and then those that annualize off will change.

I mean, it's definitely a good question, and it's something that, obviously, goes into any consideration on operating the global business because if you look across various regions, obviously, Africa from a send perspective as a good example, are typically high RPTs and high-margin corridors. I think you can probably contrast that quite considerably with growth in the Middle East, where you see a lot lower RPT and a lot less on a margin basis on a per transaction view. 
And I think the rest of the Asia Pacific market, I think, tends to vary a bit. And then obviously, kind of a Latin America impact, which is a bit of a mixed bag as well, depending on which countries you're actually operating in. 
So when you look at it holistically, I think what we're trying to do is run that portfolio of business. And, obviously, sometimes you don't have complete control over what's happening in different markets as different things are shifting, maybe from a geopolitical perspective, maybe from an economic challenge or a currency challenge, and so sometimes you're going to get a different mix in any given month or any given quarter. 
I think -- that being said, from a marginal perspective, we're definitely looking at this from an incremental transaction, incremental customer perspective. And the more volume we can drive with the lower -- with the low-cost structure that we have and the scale that we put through, we think it's really a scale game at this point and it's about volume, and it's not so much a concern about an individual per transactional basis. 
So I think we're going to continue to see mixed and kind of how RPTs are coming in from various corridors, but that's going to flow into the P&L in a very different way, right? So I think, at the end of the day, margin should be relatively neutral based on corridor mix. But I think it's the net of how we can do from a scale perspective that's going to make the difference.

They've also done quite well in the classified domain in terms of new awards and have been converting those new awards into revenue. They also are working and completing up on the Next Generation Jammer EMD program, which is in full swing. I know they're a significant revenue generator for the overall business. And I can tell you, they're operating on all cylinders relative to all the other programs that they have in there. And it's a good healthy mix. I would call it new programs coming onboard.

Look, thinking about overall performance from our free cash flow, year-over-year, I think we're still talking about north of 20% growth, so very solid growth from 2017 to 2018. You'll recall earlier in the year, we raised free cash flow guidance. We had subsequently lowered it. And really what has to do with is a couple of other factors that we discussed during this call. One is to the extent that you fall short on the sales forecast, I mean, it's very difficult to adjust your supply chain planning such that there is not an inventory build that takes place. The second thing is, we're very pleased with the performance coming out of our North Cove manufacturing facility, but that has been overproducing in terms of getting fully back up to speed ahead of our expectations, which is another factor contributing a bit to the inventory build. And then as we said earlier, when we look at year-over-year performance, we did make some strategic decisions to make select product inventory build. So really, those are the 3 factors that we see. We do not see this as a structural issue. And frankly, once we kind of tighten up our forecast going into next year, this will be an opportunity for us to call this back. So this year was -- if we think about the progression of free cash flow, we've gone from $300 million in 2015 to $1.5 billion in 2018 inherently. And when you see that kind of extraordinary growth, there will be some volatility and some puts and takes. We wanted to make sure we share the, obviously, the most updated thinking in terms of where we see this landing. But like I said, I don't believe this is a structural issue that we're faced with, and we will plan accordingly, as we look to next year.",2

Other than that, if anything, we -- as we build out e-comm and have more inventory in our -- in there and want to make sure we're trying to grow it, that actually probably impacted a little negatively, notwithstanding the fact that it's currently a very strong number.
We also have some programs where, ideally, sometimes you'll have vendors, usually smaller vendors, that even though we and they have negotiated extended terms in some cases, particularly on seasonal items or stuff that's coming in a few months hence, sometimes, if they need working capital, it's a good rate of return for us to pay early, if you will, what's called anticipation.

I think some of the more outlying areas a little bit in the south where we needed to fix and also where some of our other formats, some of our Super Fresh stores have less relevance in some of those markets than they could. And I think -- I would say if the recession persists, that’s exactly what we are trying to adjust ourselves too, and if it gets better, that’s just bonus.
So all the things that we are doing are really -- the way in which we are planning, just so you know, is as the recession will continue.

So I think, with those 2 things, we should be reverting back to the mean, all things equal.

So we look at that a lot. Yes, pricing is -- so directionally, there is definitely good news on the loss trend side, now it's a very long tail line of business. So short-term movements in loss trend get blended in as we look at long-tail loss trend. But loss trends have been positive, but pricing is reacting and probably overreacting to that in the marketplace. So we're looking at it very closely. There has been some disruption with carriers out there in the market, and we are looking at that business closely. It's still got to meet the economic hurdles that we have in the profitability, so to the extent that there are opportunities out there that we think we can write at appropriately prices, and we're excited about it.

That tells you we've got more to look at, which we're thrilled with. That gives us a chance to have better quality. I would also say there continues to be not a whole lot of competition for those boxes, so that helps us in the overall pricing. What we have seen in the mix in more leases than buys. So before we had planned on 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, a 1/3 second-generation leases, a 1/3 second-generation purchases and a 1/3 ground-up builds. What we're seeing is there's a whole lot more leases available and people aren't willing to sell it to us, and so we're leasing them. And we are still building them. But as we've found more opportunities to do second-gen leases, we pushed some of our builds out so that's why the leases have gone down as a percentage. And now it's about 75% second gen, 25% ground-up build. I would say overall, I was on a trip business, we were looking at some new locations in the Mid-Atlantic area. I would say the location quality continues to be a positive for us. Our team just got back from ICSC in Las Vegas. 5 years ago we had to explain who we are. Now 5 years since then, we've become the belle of the ball. They all want to talk to us. Every developer wants to work with us.

So what we did to just clarify to make sure that this is accurate as possible, do it on a SIC Code basis. So if there was, let’s call it a retail store that had some renovation, maybe historically, we've categorized as construction, now it's under retail.

And it's largely incremental business. So we can compare it to other components. But as we add incremental business, it's incremental revenues in process to Western Union. And we play a very different role. So if you look at the top line, or revenue per transaction in digital white label, it's going to naturally be lower than the rest of our business because of the processor role that we're playing. Because we don't have the custom acquisition costs. We don't have the fraud losses, other expenses and doing that kind of business. It really is a big customer that's being delivered to us that we are moving money for. And the rest of that process is relatively low cost, seeing a very high margin. 
The dollar contribution is going to be different than the rest of our business from the white label, but some of them actually are quite profitable and not too far away for the rest of our business. So I think it just depends.

But at least that's the way we see it. There are a couple of factors that tend to convince us that this is not a repeat of 2008, 2009 in the demand patterns we're seeing. The first thing is in 2008 and 2009, we saw very significant weakness in a few market segments and this time, when we look at all the product segments and all the market segments that we serve, we saw them all go down at about the same rate, which to us seems to indicate it's more -- at least for us in Q3, it's more about supply than demand. The other fact that our distributors point out to us in our recent conversation is that they haven't seen a lot of significant cancellations or backlog adjustments, which indicates to them mostly what we're seeing is an orderly reduction of inventory rather than the severe dislocations that we all experienced in 2008 and 2009. So at Analog, unlike many other companies in the industry, we had a very significant run up in Q2, well above our seasonal rates. When we grow 9% sequentially in the quarter, that typically, we'd grow 4% to 5%. That sort of rates that there was an inventory built in the channel and most of what we saw last quarter from both the distributors statistics and also the commentaries from our largest customers, the great thing to believe, it's much more about -- at least in Q3, much more about supply than demand. It's also interesting in Analog what Dave mentioned when we reported our distribution sales, which were half of our sales were sellout. So last quarter, the distributor's built quite a bit of inventory, which shows up as revenues for many companies, but not revenues for Analog Devices. 
So while we would all that up, and we listened to the comments from the large customers, the comments from our distributors, at least in Q3, I believe we will come to believe that it was mostly about supply gyrations, not demand. I think as far as what happens in the future, we really don't know. You could read this report or that, you can read a summary or that, I mean this editorial of New York Times or another one of The Wall Street Journal, and there's a bunch of opinions out there of what's going to happen. And we can't predict that, which is why the range of possibilities for Q4, at least as we see it, is very large. 
In the short term, as, I think, Dave indicated and I made some comments on, we're really being careful on discretionary expenses. We have a natural hedge on our expense growth with the variable comp plan, which when -- last year's results were coming in, was paying at an extremely high rates and has now cycle down pretty hard, and will continue to as results are getting better. We're reallocating resources to the projects and the segments, and the customers that are the most strategically relevant  for us. We have very low and variable manufacturing cost structure. So I think we're in pretty good shape to react to anything the world throws at us, although I would repeat, we really just don't know what the world is going to throw at us next quarter. But I think we have a very resilient business model now, much more resilient than it was 2 or 3 years ago, much more of our costs of variable and our product portfolio is lot less volatile than what it has been. So again, if the world goes to hell, our results won't be that great, but I think we're well-suited to respond to whatever the world throws at us.",-3
599619,42556987,1010209,108616,"The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.","Well, yes, you're right. It somehow seems that our client wins don't get announced while some of our competitors do. The answer to your first part of your question is, we continue to be net new business positive, which is an indication of the strength of our offerings. I did indicate a number of our recent wins in my prepared remarks, notably the recent retention of the BMW work at Mediabrands, which is a very good retention for us, obviously, and the wins at McCann and Weber with respect to Reckitt Benckiser. We do expect to announce a nice win coming up in the next couple of weeks. We hope that will happen, which will be a global engagement, we hope, using the integrated open architecture approach. We don't like to give out tailwinds because -- let me just comment here. It's so hard in this business. When we lose clients, it's very easy for us to know the impact of when that revenue is going to be coming off. So when we talk about tailwinds and headwinds, the headwinds are easy. We don't like them, but we can specifically know when that comes off because the contracts provide for that, and we know our staffing requirements and so on. Our new business wins come into 2016, a number of them came at the end of the year. And frankly, we win the business and then we have contract negotiations and scope of work is developed as we go through, and that's one of the contributing factors, and the fact that, as we said, we had good tailwinds coming into the first half of the year and some of that work is slipping over into the second half of the year. So yes, we have some tailwinds now in the second half of the year. And the timing of those tailwinds and when they're recognized is a function of when the work is shown. There are a whole bunch of issues that go into that. So the answer is we have some tailwinds in the second half. All of that gets factored into the overall forecast that when we say our target is 3% to 4% on the high end of 4%, we take into consideration a year performance. As I said before, our clients don't know what our quarterly requirements are for financial reporting, which is why we stick to our notion that given the macro environment, we're comfortable with what we set out as a stated goal, which includes revenue performance and our conversion. And the fact that our conversion will be stronger in the second half is consistent with the way our business has rolled out in prior years.",2
505467,35199351,809408,245507,Visteon Corporation,"Good. I'm glad to talk about something besides proceeds, Brian, so that's -- I appreciate your question. The content that we're seeing, and I mentioned earlier that the momentum of new and rewin business in 2014 is continuing into 2015, and it's very rare if the replacement product is in a lower price. There's additional content, usually throughout the [indiscernible] applications. But you're also seeing new stuff. We've mentioned in the past SmartCore. SmartCore is a much higher vehicle content product than historical, more than just a reconfigurable cluster. So we're seeing added content. So I think the case in point there is on a $3 billion business base with a $1.3 billion win, of which $800 million was new business, you're seeing us grow faster than vehicle build. And that's driven by either share or content. And quite honestly, it's both over time. As you get into the 2018, 2019 perspective, you see that there's a lot driven by content. I think one of the metrics, and we talked about it internally, is being more explicit on content per vehicle and looking at those trends. And now that we're just a single-focus product, which is Electronics, we can probably do that more easily. And we'll talk about being more public about the type of information. But it's all headed in that direction. We're not winning business based on cutthroat pricing. This is all a technology-driven game. And that technology game implies that there's more content as you move up. And even on these vehicles here, I'll give you a case in point. There's -- we had a vehicle application between first -- let's say, generation 1, and then it went to generation 2 in the next platform, is that the cost of the -- of our components went up $50 per vehicle. The plastic vessels and surround that support that went down by $50 the -- because to the consumer, he did not see a difference in the cost base of the OEM. He didn't see a difference in cost base. But our component, our portion of that went up considerably. And we're seeing, as we look throughout many applications, that type of story.",2
1073920,62673619,1588022,312769,Vulcan Materials Company,"I think is what we've been saying is week-over-week, month-over-month, the work we're putting in is in higher prices. So -- and we have put in a lot of work. So I would say that the bid work will continue to step up much similar than what you saw between Q3 and Q4. Suzanne called out, it was 50 basis points. And so as every day, you're working off replacing it with new higher price work. I think the market gets it. And so there'll be 2 -- there'll be kind of 2 stages to price increase, month-over-month, week-over-week, the bid work will continue to march up as -- and that will just continue to '19. And then your fixed plant work, you'll see a bigger jump in January as fixed plant price increases go into effect for the year. Does that make sense?",1

1323975,72855672,1861862,4222231,"Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mike. This is Coddy. Well, first, as Dennis highlighted on the call, we're sort of particularly excited to be this side of BlizzCon and to -- being able to have Blizzard walk through just what's coming in the upcoming content pipeline there. And when you couple that with the initiatives underway at Activision and King, we do feel that we're looking at the strongest content pipeline that this company has had in its history.
And one of the reasons for that are the important steps that we've taken over the last year to make that possible: the investments we've made in our development resources, the focus on our core franchises that push to make sure that the content cadence across upfront live operations and mobile sits across all of our key franchises where appropriate.
And we took some steps as well to make sure we could fund that by deprioritizing other areas, all in service of getting to this moment where we could show the content cadence for players coming up and deliver to expectations and above.
I think the early results are a really important signpost to look at on this growth road that we are on. When you think about WoW Classic, it is a major expansion coming into that universe in an off year. Typically, it's every other year expansion. A major expansion that comes in and has a significant step change impact on the reach of that franchise. 
Similarly, COD Mobile. While partners outside development to pull that off, we had to make significant investment inside our production and publishing capabilities, and again, a step change in that franchise's reach and engagement. And then Modern Warfare, which we think stands alone in terms of an experience, and as Rob highlighted, will continue to do so.
So those aren't just sort of green shoots. Those are real signposts and milestones of the growth that we think is possible. And it points to what we think is coming, some of which you know concretely. WoW Shadowlands coming in 2020, Hearthstone Battlegrounds, Warcraft III: Reforged. There are items we haven't announced the dates for but with significant moves for the community, Diablo Immortal, Diablo IV, Overwatch. And we have a similar level of investment and focus coming up in the pipelines that are at Activision and at King.
And so when we step back, we feel like we're at this moment where we can take this significant pipeline forward. And really, if you want -- if you're looking on the outside and you want the strongest pipeline in the industry, we think it's here at Activision Blizzard.",3

Rupert may have forgot this. But if you go back, if you compare where we were 2008 to where we are today, I mean today as a company is much, much stronger financially, the nature of the company has changed. The predictability of our earnings have changed if you look at where we're going with our cable business. And in 2008, at one point, we thought that the financial world was coming to an end so we're extremely, extremely conservative. So I just think we're in a totally different place today from where we were in 2008 with respect to our ability and capacity to buy back stock.",1
64835,9474570,147565,290203,Viatris Inc.,"Yes, on a constant currency basis. As far as France goes, I think there's a couple of dynamics at play. First, I want to reiterate that we have maintained our market share. We're holding as the leader in that market, with about 30% market share. So that has not changed. But to your point, what has changed is, as I stated in my remarks, is that not only a competitive landscape, but we see it as somewhat of an irrational. And I wanted to point out and emphasize that we're really managing top and bottom line. So while doing that and being able to maintain market share, our market share and maintain our year guidance to the midpoint of $2, we think all of that, combined shows again the diversity on what we've been able to maintain and absorb. I see that there is some overhang from the Mediator scandal that's going on in France right now. They put about 70 products on a watch list, and all that stems from a conflict of interest between the industry and AFSSAPS with a couple of the local participants in France. So they're really taking a hard look and I think that, that overhang lift as AFSSAPS gets comfortable with the remaining product line. And as far as -- we mentioned Spain, of course, having some pressures, but we do still see generic utilization increasing. We see nice market share continuing to increase in Italy. So again, in a substitution marketplace, we really see no fundamental change over the long-term. And so while some of these pressures are perhaps going a little longer than we have anticipated at the beginning of the year, nothing's changed as far as our long-term guidance and we still see a lot of opportunity in Europe as the macro environment lifts.",2

It's really our revenue managers who decide whether they want to take more bookings now or save their powder for later on. And they are making decision. Michael, Lisa, Larry have to choose exactly how they want to ramp up. And so it probably -- I don't want to give the impression that bookings are so strong that the booking curve got longer out. It's really looking at all the factors. Our people felt that it should be a longer-term booking curve. And I -- my guess is that next year, even if it's a stronger year, they will want a slightly shorter booking curve. But that's a decision we make rather than something that is determined based simply on there's enough demand and so we book up ahead. So if, at the end of this year, we actually end up saying we want or we have fewer bookings for the following year but at higher prices, that wouldn't be necessarily a negative sign.",1

So to sit there and say that that occurred at the smallest quarter of the year -- will that continue in the larger ones? But it's only happened once in the last 18 years. So to project that out to the next 3 quarters, we don't have that in our guidance.",2

I'm not sure that we've ever run you know large enough price cuts or done so in a way because we've lost a lot of volume in a certain corridor and a certain area of the business that we've then had the measure, though the retention of those consumers and we've cut those prices, I mean I think anytime we've reduced prices we've done it from in a measured manner and in an effort to maintain market share but also maximize revenue again currently and further down the road. I mean I have no doubt in my mind that if we moved all of our prices to zero, we do a lot of transactions, but it’s not really going to get me anywhere. So you know in the end, you have to balance that all together and you got to look at where your growth opportunities are, you've got to look at your current markets, you've got to look at maturity of different markets, you have to look at migration flows within that, etcetera, etcetera. So I think we are targeting our consumers.

And then as Jim mentioned, our composites automated lay-up and NDT equipment for Milledgeville, and that's to support higher rates of production on the 787. The other category is thermoplastics. And we've been investing in both, I'll call it, welding technology, and you can use that term for thermoplastics, as well as the automation to position noncontact heads over composites and perform these welds on blind joints and joints of different thicknesses.

743412,48342569,1174949,27807,"E*TRADE Financial, LLC","Sure. Looking at what went on during the quarter around the price cuts initially, it was a lot of calls from our customers and a lot of interested parties trying to figure out what was going on in the space, there was certainly no large demand for lower pricing and there was no calls before that coming into us. So there were a lot of offers and asks in the marketplace to match pricing and see if we would sort of lower down to where they were. So like I said before, it's sort of a hand-to-hand combat on the higher end of the book to make sure that we're providing pricing. But keep in mind that, what we always say and it holds true today, the higher end of our book is on negotiated pricing, and they provide a lot more to us than just commission per trade. They have large cash balances with us, they have large margin receivables sit with us. So it was some pretty heavy sledding for our customer service reps and for our FCs on the ground working with customers. And our pricing changes I think resolved a lot of that, bringing it down to $6.95, because our offering overall provides a significant amount of value to our customers. That was true before the price cuts, and it remains true after the price cuts. What they gave us the opportunity to do in the price cuts was really pull forward what we're thinking about and looking at internally for post-integration on the OptionsHouse side. It's also allowed us to redefine what we look at as an active account and looking at 30 trades per quarter as opposed to the 150 that we used to use, which we believe is the right customer and the right type to go after with our improved options capabilities and derivatives tradings capabilities, our client services team that we've put in place on the Active Traders side, our derivatives services guys. So we think we're in the right place now. In terms of positioning the franchise for additional cuts -- just to take a step back, when I look at what went on, and Mike hit it head-on in his prepared remarks, in 2010, we went through this, right, and we saw there's price cut and matching, and we collapsed some tiers. And there's really no reallocation among the larger players. There was a lot of lower pricing, a lot of revenue foregone and a lot of shareholder value that went out the door, but we didn't really see a lot of reallocation amongst. So in my view, I don't really want to see additional price cuts come through. But Mike's right, we'll do everything we can to defend the franchise. And in terms of if we will have to go down lower, if we have to match, if we have to do what we need to do to keep our customers in our book, it's the most valuable asset we have. So it's really more of the same should that happen. I don't think it's rational to think about additional price cuts at this point in time, particularly given what we're seeing in the early days, but we'll see how it ends up. And it's not always necessarily within our control, but we'll absolutely defend our franchise.",-2

We begin marketing that really in the -- in August of the prior year. And we've been very successful at getting people to buy those season passes early. The other leg is to get people to buy season passes when they do walk up, either when they're buying a ticket online or particularly when they walk up to the gate to buy a one-day ticket. And we've seen pretty good success in that as well. And so I think you're right. I think that obviously, as you think about the revenue being recognized when we're able to convert that one-day ticket person to a season pass that day, we're going to recognize less revenue on that day. But ultimately, they're going to come back to the park 3 or 4x. And we'll recognize that higher revenue over the season. And every time they come to the park, they're going to spend money. So ultimately, it's a win-win. We've talked before about the fact that typically, we see season pass holders spending more than twice the amount of -- over the season, twice the amount of revenue.

So we needed to create some space for our existing customers to grow in. We were able to secure a 25% pre-lease it’s in a wonderful BBD and so for us it made good sense to go and pull the trigger on that and we’ll soon start having to steel up. 
We’ve done a lot of in-ground work on that, but it’s 2015 before it delivers, so we have a lot of time to do additional prospecting. We just need to study the submarket, see who the probable customers are who have rolling expirations dates in and the time around that we’d be able to deliver the building and what the nuances of that particular submarket are at this point in time.

I would say this is really just a testament to the discipline that our teams live and breathe each day. We went out with some messaging, sort of just some reminders and playbooks to folks. When we saw the sort of the concern and the shutdown hitting just coaching people on how to manage through it, right? And well the team just did a great job resizing the business I was appropriate, making sure that we were cutting costs, being disciplined. And obviously, some of the things we did to give ourselves a little lesser flexibility more broadly as a company. We talked about that. Delaying wages, salary cuts for executives, sort of delaying wage increases and salary cuts for executives. Those were things that we thought were necessary just to give ourselves that flexibility. Clearly, we did very, very well as we went through that sort of pause period. 
Since then, with the recovery that we've seen, we've reinstituted the merit increases. We restored all those cuts that we made. And the nature of the resizing of the business has been very specific to the locations. So we try to retain the staff and making sure we weren't hurting ourselves strategically. Our ability to compete, our ability to win, we didn't want to undermine that by being too aggressive because we don't believe that we've allowed ourselves to get fat in these markets. There wasn't a ton of the cut. 
So what you saw at the end of the day was, I think, some real flexibility in the core around comp that some of that will come back, obviously, in terms of expenses. You saw about 1/3 of that overall benefit being TBD now that one's a bit more time to play out. The question remains, will it ever get back to normal, will we ever travel like we used to? TBD, but certainly, that we anticipate will come back to some degree over time. Then about 1/3, it was really the fuel expense. And obviously, there's been some volatility in the cost of fuel. So that will normalize to wherever it's going to normalize to over time, maybe not right away on that one either. But we didn't go back through this organization and make any real structural changes or massive cuts. Our focus is on making sure we were responding and being ready to move forward.

Let me separate the 2 different metrics, if I understood your question, customer sell-through versus what they're ordering from us? So we exited the quarter in terms of what they're ordering from us, and roughly flat to, I think, the term I used in my prepared statement was normal -- back-to-normal type levels. And so that is what we saw coming out of the quarter with what they're purchasing from us. But again, some very good indications of strong orders coming into the third quarter. 
In terms of their sell-throughs, their POS, they were really exceeding previous year's POS in all 3 areas to give you a little bit of a breakdown between the 3 divisions. And also, it's always important to couch this in that we don't get information from all of our customers, we just get it from -- enough to say that we believe it is representative and directional, but you can't necessarily run with that percentage and say that, that's everybody. 
But what we did see within engine management, as we said, April was down double digits. June was up double digits. And that brings them to basically flat year-to-date. 
The interesting phenomenon is in wire and cable, and I think you can see this, Nathan was giving you the breakout of our revenues in wire versus engine. Wire actually slightly outperformed engine, and we're seeing that at the POS level as well. And I think we're seeing this as a bit of an influence, but you're hearing some of the big retailers discussing as well, that it's been a bit of a shift towards DIY, which tends to move you to the older technologies and the product categories that do-it-yourself or is able to work with. So we've actually seen wire and cable, which, historically, is down 7%, 8% category, outperforming. We think that's a temporary situation. But that has been an interesting dynamic with the older technologies, which wire is included. 
Temperature Control, you have to look at this in the seasonal nature of the category. So April and May are still largely irrelevant. It really has to do with June in terms of the quarter, and June was hot. And so their sales up were in -- definitely in double digits, and that trend does continue into the third quarter.",3

And during that period of time, the content for aluminum extrusions grew at about a 4% CAGR. So we are confident even if they make changes in CAFE regs, they're not really going -- they're not going to take away the increases in CAFE regs. They may knock down that 50-mile per gallon standard, but the real challenge and the reason that the automotive manufacturers are complaining is that to get to those 50-mile an hour standards require dramatic changes and very expensive changes in engine technology. But the most cost-efficient way for them to achieve greater fuel efficiency is be a light weighting, which is what was happening for the prior 2 decades before the CAFE standard started ramping up. So we watch this obviously, but in terms of aluminum extrusion content, we remain confident that regardless of what they do with CAFE standards, we think there's still going to be pressure for fuel efficiency from both the regulations, but also from the consumers and we're very confident, we're going to see growing content for our products, whether it's 5% or 6% or whether the number is longer term, it's going to be very, very strong growth for many years.",3

1453412,81377799,2074180,3632895,Las Vegas Sands Corp.,"No, we need more, more customers, and we need lots more. The truth is the hotels are running in this town, mid-week, 20%, 25%, 30%; weekends, 50%, 60%. That doesn't work. They're only coming basically from drive-in markets, so in a lot of the markets, not just international but throughout the U.S.
Actually, we've had a very high-yielding, very strong customer because our marketing team has incented. We brought some great business in using our airplanes and our marketing, our lists. We see actually a very strong high-end play from both slots and tables. Extraordinary amounts of players have gone through here. 
The problem is, as you know, it takes a lot of different segments to make this company make the $0.5 billion in Las Vegas we did last year. We don't have any convention business. There's no yield on the week -- on mid-week from the -- on the room side. 
You're seeing strong FIT demand weekend, but there's nothing else in there but FIT, strong high-end casino demand. Our numbers might surprise you [ in casino ] how good they are in terms of the slot machines and the table yields. We're not -- yes, they're seeing some drive-in business, which is not very high demand gaming side. 
But again, Vegas has morphed into a hospitality-driven market. And I think, for a lot of people, it's confusing. Even people who operate here surprise me sometimes, that they're surprised how soft it is. Without the hotel being full, without the convention driving the rates midweek, without the banquet piece -- we did here almost $200 million in banquet sales at massive margins -- it's just very hard for our model to work, and I assume that's true in the entire marketplace. If you're running a large-scale building, like most of these buildings are, you're not getting by on gaming win, no matter how good it is. You're not getting by with 30%, 40% occupancy. If you're making money on a weekend, which we can, you're losing it back midweek, which we all do. And I don't think that picture is different from most. 
It's just that this company has been such an incredible success story in the convention banquet segments. We've driven so much business through here. I mean last year, again, I think we broke a $0.5 billion of EBITDA. But to do that, you can't run a hotel with these kind of occupancies. You can't run a no-banquet facility. You can't rely on high rollers. It just doesn't work. Those days in 1967 left. 
And so this is a new business in Las Vegas. And what allows you to build these multibillion-dollar buildings is the true IR nature of what Sheldon authored 20 years ago. I mean this town has moved away from the gaming-dependent to a very diversified plan. And I don't know how you fix it until you get airlift that enables you -- and groups that feel comfortable coming back here and banquets coming back here, and that's just a fact of life. And I don't think we're alone in this thinking. 
So we remain hopeful that things will turn. But the Las Vegas here in July of '20 is in a very difficult place. And I hope it gets better, but that's the truth of the market today.",-3

So there'll be a onetime purchase of the equipment, and then there's an ongoing maintenance fee that goes along with that on a recurring basis, which is kind of similar to what you had had in your systems business as there's going to be a system component that will require upgrade and additional functionality that we'll continue to [ call ] out that's tied into those units.",0

It's surprising to us that contract prices are going down, while spot prices are slightly up from where they were, let's say, 2 months ago. And the gap seems to be widening. So why is that? And I think, the -- to get pricing momentum on contract renewals, you need 2 things. You need equipment utilization to be at levels where they are today but you also need the belief that the market is going to continue to improve and support those continued utilization levels. What's absent here is the belief that the market's going to continue to improve. Having said that, as David pointed out, we've had a lot of returns into other products of equipment that was dedicated crude oil and that equipment has been absorbed, and I frankly think will continue to be absorbed. And what you have in the market are operators that really don't like spot exposure, either because they're not equipped from an organizational perspective to work in a more dynamic market that are looking at rates that are still pretty acceptable, and committing their equipment for the next year at those rates. I think that once the market believes that the return of crude oil equipment is stabilized and it's being absorbed, I think then you'll see some pricing momentum going the other way.",-2

So we -- and I think that's consistent with what we said is that we don't know that we can hold completely flat into perpetuity, but we are aiming to be as close to flat as we can.

I mean, if I look at the puts and takes that we have to our margin, I spoke a little bit about we can have -- we have a little margin pressure this quarter in some specific deals in APJC. But otherwise, our margin is driven by the same things, right? Our pricing is very robust. We're being very disciplined. The price that you've seen in the last couple of quarters is in a range that's very, very strong, so that's good. We are still facing component headwinds. And even though it's less of a headwind, it is still higher year-over-year. The prices are up, it's, again, just the slope is less. But that's part of what we see, both in Q4 and the guide.

And I just refer back to my prepared comments where we basically had $200 million in terms of run rate for 2020. And there's a 160 initiatives that we've completed all are underway. We continue to execute against those significant items. And if you refer to Page 13 of our deck, you can see a little bit of color on those. I think the 2 -- a couple of the bigger areas that we continue to progress forward with, one is, I suppose, one of the final pillars around technical operations, which are the RFP that we've got out on the V2500 engines that power our 193 Airbus aircraft, and also around components where we will be doing more work as we progress through 2019. The other area I continue to be excited about is in distribution. We've talked before on our earnings calls and with investors about the CSS RFP that we've got going forward, so that's well underway. And then from the corporate pillar, we've invested heavily in our sourcing -- our strategic sourcing team and the leadership, and they've made tremendous progress over 2017 and 2018, and there's more to come in 2019 as we go through that. So I am confident in the glide path that we have to get to the $250 million to $300 million. There's plenty of initiatives to go, and we're well on track in terms of going forward.",2
1322347,73246434,1871824,25915843,"Expedia Group, Inc.","Yes. Mark, this is Alan. So on your first question on the ADRs. I would just say a few things as you dissect those numbers. First is on a reported basis, the ADRs we're reporting are pretty consistent through the year. The key there is that the foreign currency impact was much more of a negative in the first half and much less of a negative in the back half year. And so that kind of masks the actual kind of decline we're seeing in terms of local currency.
Relative to our expectations, we did not forecast the degree of slowdown in ADRs in North America that we ultimately ended up seeing. And in the industry, you can see that industry analysts and hotel companies also are just kind of systematically reducing their expectations on room night economics as we move through this period. So that's the largest area.
In APAC, I think you're exactly right to point out the protest in Hong Kong. Some tensions between other countries is having some impact on travel and on ADRs, and we're certainly seeing that in our business as well.",-2

We did not do the IPO because of this, but it's net-net, a very good thing for us. So if it all blows up tomorrow, we will be fine as a company. However, if health care reform does go through, further CBO, about 60% of the uninsured recovered, our estimate, or our calculation, we're taking that 60% down to 40%, and depending on how they -- you view the delta, we're only taking our delta from self-pay to Medicaid.

801282,50924197,1257066,416404,"Entegris, Inc.","I would say, I mean, to your first point. I mean clearly, volume is going to play a role in it, right? We have a fixed-cost structure and if volumes up, that obviously helps us on the gross margin. I didn't say that in my formal remarks but it kind of goes without saying. And I would just say, from a mix perspective, in the SCEM business for instance, I mean the margins, there is a wide -- there is a dispersion in the margins. And in the current quarter, for instance, specialty gas is a very good business for us. And so we had a very strong quarter in specialty gas, that actually helped us from a mix perspective. That's a for instance. But it's really -- it's hard to pinpoint 2 or 3 things. Like I said, it's just -- it's a fundamental focus on the execution at our manufacturing facilities, it's the higher volumes, it's not any 1 thing specific or even -- if I were to give you a list of what was driving the margin, it would be 10 things for every division.",1

Again, I don't -- well, first of all, we -- as we always, we have a fairly general statement that we make that we would like the markets to be free and fair. And that's the way we look at trade. We continue to look at any activity in this arena from that lens. And so we'll see how this plays out when they get to an actual decision and whether they move forward, and if they move forward, what kind of tariffs they actually put in place. But at the end of the day, we don't know what they're going to do. The petition's out there. They're moving forward with it. We know what the time line generally looks like at this point. So early next year, we should have a read on if it's going to happen and how material it is. 
The big thing is, is it's such a big -- when you're talking about over 25% of the tires that are sold in this country today coming from those 4 markets, it's just hard to see a quick response in terms of moving at some place. And so as a result, there's going to be a lot of the tires that are coming into this market that are going to have that incremental cost on it. And I think that there is the market's going to look to price to recover that cost impact, and, again, largely based on the experience that we saw from the tariff impact in '09, '10, '11 or '10,' 11, '12, I can't remember what it was, '10, '11, '12, I think, on Chinese light vehicle tires.",-1

And what we found in our Phase II work with romosozumab was that while one does see the most rapid increase in bone marrow density that has been seen with any agent that's been introduced into humans, it does plateau by a year. And by a year, essentially, what one is experiencing with continued use of romosozumab is a anti-resorptive effect, kind of magnitude effect that's generally similar to that, which you would see with marketed anti-resorptives. And so at that point, it didn't seem prudent to continue to dose people with an anabolic agent, which is a novel mechanism, et cetera, when we have the ability to adopt a paradigm of rapidly building bone in patients who require that and then kind of locking in those gains with an anti-resorptive such as Prolia. So that was a surprise to us, of course, because this is completely novel biology. And it wasn't until we got into the clinic and work with an agent in Phase II that we found that it really wasn't sensible to use the product on a chronic basis.",0
1372439,75746302,1926627,339305,Realty Income Corporation,"Yes, sure. And this is something we've talked about in the past as well, Todd. If you think about it, at least lease, the original lease tends to have a 15-year, 20-year or even 25-year sale/leaseback. And then you have options built into these leases, and those options tend to be 5-year options. And this is all disclosed in our supplemental. If you look at our history of re-leasing, and we've done north of 3,000 leases, 80%, and it's been higher more recently, 80% to 90% of the existing tenants exercised these options. And so when you reset the lease term, it's right around that 5-year time frame. It's only when we are going out and re-tenanting it with a new tenant or finding a new tenant even with 0 vacancies that we have the opportunity to go beyond the 5 to something like a 10. And those have averaged in the 6- to 7-year ZIP code.
And so if we were to do no acquisitions, I think the normalized run rate for a net lease company -- a very, very mature net lease company which is doing 0 acquisitions or very little as a percentage of their overall portfolio, the normalized weighted average lease term is going to be right around 6 to 7 years. 
And that's where the asset management and real estate operations team comes into play. And we have anticipated this and set the team up accordingly, and I think the results speak for themselves. On a quarterly basis, we shared with you what the re-leasing spread is, and we shared with you what the capital invested was with regards to tenant incentives, et cetera. And more often than not, they tend to be 0. And we've been capturing north of 100% of expiring rents, 103% this year. It was a similar number last year. And in this last quarter, it was 106%. 
So I believe that we have a team that, in fact, could be viewed as somebody that could create value when these leases start to roll and we are able to maintain the kind of re-leasing activity that we have been able to achieve over the last 3 to 4 years. That will become a growth driver for us.
But clearly, new acquisitions, one should expect, if it's a sale sale/leaseback, it should be in that 15- to 20-year ZIP code. And if it's acquired leases, it's going to have double-digit numbers. But as we become a bigger company, and unless our acquisition numbers don't keep up on a pro rata basis, the weighted average lease term is going to continue to sort of get lower and should normalize right around 7 years.",1

You punch in Kirkland Signature and the first thing -- I'm not going to tell you all to go do it now, but the first thing it does -- and costco.com doesn't come up.

And we are uniquely positioned to empower frontline workers across all our end markets. So the -- I'd say the crisis has been accelerating a number of secular trends around digitization and automation. And I think that probably spans all our vertical markets, all 4 key vertical markets. 
If we dig in a little bit deeper on retail, I'd say, grocers, which were certainly on -- large part of our customer base before. E-tailers, grocers, mass merchants are about 2/3 of our business. But the growth in just grocery revenues, but particularly buy online, pick up in store, has been quite significant. And we've seen grocers across the -- particularly in the U.S., but across -- certainly, Europe and the U.S., invest materially in enabling scaling up their ability to do omnichannel and particularly buy online and pick up in store. So that has been a big, big change. 
I think buy online, pick up at store's gone from being more of a niche application before to now mainstream. And I'd say, across the board in retail, that customers who were in segments that were struggling a bit more before or during the downturn, I think everybody recognizes now that they can't be 100% reliant on in-store purchases, that omnichannel and the e-commerce sides of their businesses needs to grow or expand. So we see people spending more -- giving more attention to kind of the omnichannel part of their business and how to be able to respond to situations like the one we had in Q2.",2

It's always tough to project when a field will go into decline. We know there is a lower water saturation which means the reserves are higher. I would say that we believe that the water saturation is still lower than from what GLJ is assuming. So that there is additional upside possible. One thing you can always tell from a plateau that’s getting extend is, it's drawing from somewhere. So, you know that the field is bigger than you originally thought. You know, so, I think we’re not expecting declines anytime soon. Maybe next year, something like that, but certainly the reservoir is performing at a much higher level than expected.",2

We don't take lightly the number of production workers that we've had to let go over the last 6 months. So I would say, while we're not willing to put a specific target out there since we are suspending guidance, I would say that it's going to be -- double-digit percentage reduction is going to be the goal in our SG&A, coupled with looking at overhead costs, which are some of the things that oftentimes can get overlooked. But as we're resizing our manufacturing footprint, particularly here in North America, there are overhead types of activities that can also be scaled down. So that's where we're pleased that our manufacturing margins have remained in the double digits. And we believe that's because we do know how to scale our workforce, both the line workers as well as the overhead, to adjust to reduced production rates. And you will be seeing some reductions in SG&A head count as well as some of the other things that Bill mentioned regarding his compensation, the Board's compensation. Clearly, travel restrictions, the way that they've played out, that's going to have a big impact on SG&A going forward.

793922,50709384,1251523,361335,Quest Diagnostics Incorporated,"Yes. No, I appreciate that. As we've talked about and raised the case, when we engage with a health care system, an integrated delivery network, we talk about 3 things. First of all, what we can do to help them with their inpatient laboratory, and that's what we refer to as a Professional Laboratory Services engagement. The second part of this is their advanced diagnostics and the reference testing. And we believe we could be a very effective provider of more and also help them on what they use. So it's another part of the discussion. And the third case is, in fact, we're in that discussion, they decide what their strategy is around hospital outreach. And PeaceHealth is a good example of that, where we bought their outreach at the same time as we're helping them with 11 of their hospital inpatient laboratories. And to your question -- specific question, in that relationship, we're also helping them with the reference work as well.

We were on track for our CO2 target this year until the Kuga PHEV situation came up with a supplier late in the year. As I mentioned today, it's a bit new news, maybe not as -- maybe not as dramatic as $100,000 retail offroader, but the electric Transit is a really big deal for Ford Motor Company. It's -- we're #1 in the U.S. We're #1 in Western Europe. And we think electrifying this product is going to be really key, and that will be a key part of our CO2 compliance, that announcement. 
So we continue to see in Europe more city restrictions. Many, many of our small and medium-sized business owners are now asking for all-electric solution. And we also think the quality of the product will be a benefit for our European customers as well. 
The Mach-E will be sold in Europe next year in volume. And so we have a great plan next year with the Mach-E. And we have a number of hybrids coming out next year in Europe in mild hybrids. I can't be specific. But we really have a great lineup in Europe, over 20 models.

1473535,82312408,2094667,334158,Ingersoll Rand Inc.,"Sure. Yes. So let me kind of take them in pieces here, Josh. I think in terms of the short-term actions, by and large, you should see those largely back in the run rate as we exit the year. As we mentioned, we got about $40 million of savings here in Q2, we would expect the majority of those to trickle back into the P&L here in Q3 and Q4, and then some of the smaller items around merit deferrals and things like that, we expect to obviously come back in the cost structure next year. 
But again, you should largely see those reentering the cost equation here as we exit 2020. And then in terms of the synergy ramp, and I think, to Nicole's question before, like we said, we've got about $80 million of in-year headcount actions. That's the major piece of the equation. You probably expected around $20 million to $25 million that in 2Q and then ramping kind of ratably between Q3 and Q4. So Q3, Q4 being a little bit higher, probably closer to that $30 million per quarter, and then the procurement piece of $15 million of in-year, that's largely all second half weighted. You really haven't seen any material amount of, I will call, integration-related or transaction-related synergies when it comes to procurement just yet. We've launched a lot of the RFQs, have a lot of good momentum on some of the initial waves, but you should expect to see that really more in the back half of the year, here in Q3 and Q4.",1

And what it's going to do is collect the number of analytics around overall nursing performance and allow hospitals who are on the [indiscernible], even those who are not, to really look at analytics around overall nursing performance and automate a lot of the data that is not currently automated today.

But one particular example would be electric vehicle charging stations. We've had 2 of our governors, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, express their desire to have significantly more electric vehicle penetration in their state. One of the impediments to accomplishing those goals is going to be a robust charging network. Utilities, like ours, and not just ours, are skilled at building infrastructure. They're skilled at planning infrastructure. They're skilled -- an example of that case of building it out in a way that it's robust, but not duplicative, doing it for a 9.5% to 10% return on equity which is a very cheap way to finance it, and I think it's something that if we really want more EV penetration, our states ought to look at having their utilities help them accomplish. Right now, none of our states want us to do that. But that's an area where I think we're going to have ongoing conversation with them about the value that we think we can bring to help them with their environmental strategies for their states.",1
