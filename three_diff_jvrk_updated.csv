I can tell you that, that wasn't unexpected. We made some schedule changes last year so we've got some difficult comps to the first and second quarters. We moved some programming more limited on our schedule that wasn't attracting the upscale audience that we want. So what's happening is, while the ratings have declined a bit, and a bit more than we expected in the first quarter to be honest, the audience composition has gotten better. And in fact, the median income has improved every quarter sequentially since we started making these moves. So just like I said before, Food Network, we have a lot of new programming coming on between now and the end of the year, the same is true with Travel Channel. And once we see that critical mass of new shows, along with the improved audience comp, we're very optimistic about Travel Channel for the rest of the year.",2,-1,-1
35,70363,9684677,151115,514044,OfficeMax Incorporated,"Let me start, Brian. This is Bruce. So if you reflect back on what we talked about in Q1, we talked about some transitory items. Clearly those are, despite their nature, nonrecurring. We talked about supply chain deleveraging. We've seem to have gotten a better handle on that at least on the Retail side. We're still -- got significant fuel cost increases running through the P&L and in the back half, that should be on the order of about 50%. So supply chain is a continuous process of making sure that we can leverage. And then in the first quarter, we had some headwinds there. And then we talked about the promotional environment and what the promotional environment drove, including weather that forced us to make some moves in the technology category. So just refreshing on what happened in Q1 last year, I'm sorry, Q1 earlier this year and then compare that to what happened this year, this year in the second quarter, our promotional environment didn't have the same elements that we saw in the first quarter. Supply chain, in this case, was not nearly the headwind that it was in the first quarter and of course, we didn't have the transitory items. So mechanically, this quarter seems to me to reflect a little better, a little more normalized sort of approach to what Retail margins might be and I'll see if Ryan, do you want to comment?",1,-2,-2

I think what we're just trying to be is reasonable with guidance, as we look at Europe, quarter-over-quarter, the last several quarters it's continued to outperform and we're at levels that from an EBITDA per ton standpoint that we haven't seen in 5-plus years. So we have the normal summer slowdown activity that we're sort of expecting to see out of Europe. I think we just wanted to be mindful of our commentary there. I don't think there's anything -- any dynamic in the market that is changed, that's giving us any cost for concern more just as we consider the business in the environment, one of those things where you just say can it continue to get better and better, we'd rather be a little more conservative from that side of thing. So, that's why we've got in the way we have with them again. Nothing that, I think, we've seen that directly is giving us that feel. Terry?",-1,2,1

Right now, parents will say that the experience is suboptimal because the kids' viewing is all through their profile.

We were still coming out of a downturn, so very different dynamics, Marion, and also we've acquired 2 luxury brands, both WinDoor and the Estate series through CGI in the last 2 years so we don't have -- last election, we didn't have the high-end market like we have it now.",2,-1,1

The scrap flows a little bit better in the spring, but they're particularly obsolete. On the prime side, I've -- we'll take a little credit and brag on the fact that we think the DRI facility, running so well as it did in the first quarter, contributes to putting a cap on the prime scrap number. So yes, the reduced exports and the improved flow of scrap in the United States because of spring, we think that's the primary reasons that the obsolete will be stable to down. And given the DRI and other alternative materials coming into the country today, prime scrap we think will be pretty stable going forward also.",2,-1,1
79,553598,40671408,957944,177031,General Electric Company,"Just a couple of things. So what we do in China, there's been very little -- albeit a little bit more lately, the differences in exchange between the U.S. and China are pretty de minimis. A lot of our business, like Aviation, are dollar based. And then obviously, in Oil & Gas and in a number -- Energy Management and a number of our other business, we do work in local currency. And so Brazil -- where we're in Brazil and Europe, in the euro, we've had a little bit of a currency impact, and that's what you hear us reporting when we give you reported versus organic. On the orders front, I don't think we've seen that big an impact. And when you look at orders in the quarter, particularly in Power, orders price has been very, very good, very strong, particularly on the H turbine, largely because we're selling out slots.",2,-1,2
161,1526971,90293321,2363328,341546,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.","Yes. In the dollars, I would say you're right. I mean if you look at it from dollars. But if you are tracking deaths, which I know you are, like we are, I mean, the drop is significant. It's, from its peak, I calculated, down close to 75%. What I said in my commentary, Gary, is that severity is up so that if you look at the number of death claims, the average amounts that we're paying, it's up from, one, the beginning of the pandemic fairly significantly and it's up from the second quarter.
I would say we probably had 8 or 9 large losses above $1 million this quarter. When anyone -- excuse me, we probably had more than that. That was just in June. So we probably have had 15 or 20 large losses when you really expect for a month. So you put it all together. And when the younger folks' mortalities increase significantly, working age, they tend to carry larger face amounts, and we're seeing that come through in the dollars.
But as I ultimately try to foreshadow is that, and we've been talking about this consistently, is that the first half of '21 and the second half is going to be dramatically different so that deaths -- daily deaths are continuing to be down, and we do feel a lessening impact of excess mortality in the second half of the year.",2,-1,-1
233,1349430,74686496,1903127,340196,ResMed Inc.,"Yes. Thanks. John, yes, it was low this quarter, and we did benefit certainly from much lower litigation-related expenses this quarter relative to last year. So that did certainly moderate that growth rate.
In my guidance, I said I think we'll revert back to the range of 23% to 25% for the second half, which would suggest that we will track higher in terms of growth rates for SG&A, at least in the back half, but certainly helped by some reduction or significant reduction in litigation costs coming through this quarter relative to last year. It was probably the single biggest driver, and that certainly moderated the growth rate. And try to adjust for that in that kind of range that I've given as a percentage of revenue going forward to be a better indicator, I think.",-1,2,-1
242,585708,41371635,975134,278553,"Hornbeck Offshore Services, Inc.","Yes, it's correct. It just depends on how long the downturn is. As you know, whether it's our type of equipment with the vessels, the high-end vessels or the drillships or the semisubmersibles, we're all kind of in the same boat, excuse the pun. But getting qualified mariners for all that equipment will take some lead time. During the upcycle, we did pack the pipeline with a lot of qualified mariners, did a lot of training. This is still a great industry to come back to when it kicks back up again. But it is at a price, and it is at a cost. And that's why I think longer term, right now, the oil industry is really pushing down on the backs of the service companies to get cost down. But there's only so much cost we can really go down. 2/3 of our daily cost are crew. And that's in indicative throughout the industry. And if we shut it down and then we have to get these highly complimented, like you said, brain surgeons back. It's not going to be cheap. So that cost structure will go back up as the green shoots start and the industry comes back. But in the interim, it make absolutely no sense for companies to keep equipment in the market to subsidize the industry and just burn all of their crash because that's what's happening today. I think a lot more equipment needs to be stacked throughout the industry not just in the Gulf of Mexico but worldwide.",-3,0,-3

And we mentioned that in the release that it has a positive effect of 6% estimated already from quarter 1, but it's offset by a platform changeover that has a negative impact in the first quarter that we do not see for the remaining part of that year. So it's happening as we speak, but will continue with less negative offset for quarter 2 to quarter 4.",-2,1,-1
288,1375319,75940555,1931703,344284,iStar Inc.,"Yes. Interesting, I think what we're seeing from third parties now is a recognition of the cash flows coming off these ground leases, big enough, very safe, diverse, do look a lot like some of the highest-grade, long-duration bonds out there. 
And so if you look at similar credit quality, similar credit risk and term securities that trade every day on the screen, we're seeing that methodology that we thought was appropriate, start to be adopted by a number of third parties. 
So first step in valuation was just getting people to see that cash flow stream and use the appropriate discount rates. And we're starting to see that reflected, again, in the share price. 
That alone, I think, justifies a price well above where we've seen the stock trade. We also are now starting to share with people based on last year's significant growth, a sort of future-looking component, what are the future deals and future cash flows going to create? 
Again, this is a unique business, we actually think we're creating significant above-market returns. So we're not just buying commodities. We're actually creating a fundamentally new business that still has excess returns in it because it costs a lot of money to build the machine to actually serve our customers. So there's a second component there. And that will come down to what you think our growth rate is and where you think future pricing will come out. 
And then as you point out, the third piece is the residual piece, which in an individual ground lease probably doesn't have a lot of value, idiosyncratic risk, long time frames, discount rates that are probably north of the growth rates. So we haven't spent a lot of time sharing, sort of the thought process around any individual ground lease residuals. What we have been doing is tracking for you and for others, the amount of value-building up in that account, what we call the unrealized capital appreciation. And we think that's a real asset. And we are going to come back to you with a number of thoughts around how that can and should be valued. But that is something that requires the scaling, the diversifying that Marcos talked about. It doesn't make sense to talk about it on individual deals. But as we get larger, as we continue to scale, you will see us begin to focus on that component more heavily. 
Right now, Jade, to be honest, we just want people to get the cash flow piece right. Because even that, we still think is significantly undervalued. So in time, we think all 3 pieces will get valued by the market. But the first, the straight -- most straightforward, the one that everybody should be able to see right now, even that one, we're still trying to knock down some inaccurate views. And once that happens, again, I think you'll see a number per share that will make everyone pretty happy.",2,-1,-1
295,1066739,62458860,1582436,310078,Union Pacific Corporation,"Yes. That's a great question. In this year, we've been working through the failure costs or the inefficiency costs that I've talked about. So this year is not a good benchmark, but I think it helps inform and influence and set us up for a strong year in 2019, because we have every expectation that we're going to remove those inefficiency costs that we've seen throughout 2018 and then do way more than that with the Unified Plan 2020. So it's a big number. I can't tell you how to model other than we're showing confidence in our ability to drive productivity and, as we've said here, we're confident that -- or our belief at this point at the early planning phase is that volume will be on the positive side of the ledger and we're just as confident as ever on our ability to drive price above inflation. So from a modeling standpoint, you'll have to, kind of, take those parameters and do what you think the economy is going to look like. But I would say that the $500 million, and again, I said at least $500 million, is a big number. I mean, you can look at historically maybe if you went back over a long period of time, you'd see UP in the 250-ish kind of range. So we think $500 million in any 1 year plus is a big productivity achievement.",-1,2,1

Less so in RV, where we're shipping product, and there, we're working off of good backlogs. As far as the retail on the RV side, this sounds a little crazy, but boy, if we can get 3 months of good weather here, especially in the spring buying season, things can turn on the dime in this industry, just as quickly as they can really come to a really slowing effect with bad weather. People have to be out there touching the product to buy it. And they don't like to do that in snowstorms and tornadoes and thunderstorms. So a little bit of luck with the weather kind of in the next 3 months, those retail lots will start to go down quite a bit. I -- the industry is pretty good about predicting. They do a lot of work on where they see the demand, and they're projecting mid-single-digit type growth this year, low to mid-single-digit growth. And I think that's going to happen.

Historically, when we look for a third leg to our stool, as we like to talk about, or I like to talk about it, and we're looking heavily at oil or liquids areas. We just -- we didn't do anything better in those areas other than the very sweet spots at $80, well than we did with our existing assets of $4 a gas. Now we got blindsided by where gas prices end up because of oversupply. But -- so we continue to evaluate other opportunities. We've got a couple that we're really keen on right now. But you see the relative oversupply of NGLs and the collapse of pricing there. There's some areas that high returns in February, March have minimal returns now. So we have to be mindful of that.

I mean the first answer is that we're committed to continually renovating and maintaining our asset base at a very high level. And that will not stop. We have paused in 2020. We're doing a few properties in South Florida that had already been underway, but after that, we will pause because we want to make sure our renovation strategy is well aligned with our brand strategy and it's well aligned with our asset management strategy. But we do expect to complete sort of that revamping of how we want to approach renovations this year. We certainly will be back in the market for renovating assets perhaps on a more selective basis in 2021 once we have completed that strategy. But I think the good news is that when we look at our social media scores, when we look at what customers say about us on TripAdvisor and the feedback that we get from customers, we don't get a lot of feedback that says, ""We didn't enjoy our stay because your hotel wasn't renovated or it's not brand new."" The feedback we've got is, ""There was something in my room that didn't work. My room wasn't clean."" Maybe the service wasn't up to standards. Those are things we can attack this year. Before I spend or we spend a lot of money on renovating our properties, I want to make sure our operational house is sound and that we can maintain these properties and we can keep them clean and we can provide the right service, and then we'll see the lift from renovations that we need.",-1,2,1

It's really just a tribute  to Geraud and the team. They've been able to take out a lot more cost, a lot more quickly than what we had anticipated. But I think more importantly, they've been able to stabilize some of the other businesses at F&S where we saw issues last year, especially in Europe. We're not getting much traction on the top line with the F&S businesses. But the bottom line is getting better as there's more discipline around pricing, more discipline around the contracts that we're taking. So a lot of the bad news that we saw last year, bad news, surprises coming out of the U.K., for instance, again, sales aren't up in the U.K. but profits are now on the legacy F&S business just because of the discipline I think that Geraud and the management team has brought to the pricing process there.",2,-1,-2

And certainly, we'll make sure to keep a prudent amount of cash on the balance sheet. But beyond that, there's no real need to stockpile it. We're not going to focus on dividends for a while. We're not going to focus on share buyback beyond the very large amount we're talking about upfront. And we're not a big one for sort of cash acquisitions or capital expenditures or anything like that. 
So our goal would be to pay the debt down as fast as we possibly can. And I think if we started off with a strong year, I think you'd certainly see us do that at a much faster rate than what's required by the loan documentation, which is meant to be sort of a bare minimum as opposed to a larger amount. And again, there's no penalty at all to repaying on a cash flow. So we've had every incentive to do it as quickly as possible, and obviously, the deleveraging is a big part of our equity story going forward. So we have yet another reason to do that.",-1,2,-1

They're operators that, generally speaking, we're not growing with. And therefore, we're probably better off freeing them up to grow their business with a different capital partner.

But so to answer your question, Kimberly, first is the -- do we have a full set of strategies to address the needs to turn our business in the right direction? I'd say the answer is they're still developing. We're going to be talking about some of the strategies that we have developed in the near term. We've got a meeting planned for our internal organization to express some of these new ideas and thoughts. But I can assure you that there's more to do. We feel great about the progress, the investments we've made on our digital platform with our online business chugging along nicely and very well developed. As Karen said, the investments we've made in our Macy's app has been very positively received. So we're doing some good things there. But clearly, the answer has to lie in our conversion of consumers who are shopping in our physical stores into sales instead of just shopping and browsing and then clicking and buying either at macys.com or somewhere else, converting them into purchasers inside of our stores. And we've got test stores lined up, we've got a lot of exciting things that we're testing and doing. But as Karen alluded to, it'll be a bad idea for us to just roll those out immediately and hope they work. So rather, we're going to spend '17 to try various new formats that we do believe will improve our conversion rate. And then the ones that do work, as we've experienced and we've figure out with ladies' shoes and with fine jewelry, we'll do those and roll that out hopefully later in the season in '17 and '18. So those are still underway. And then to your point about is this different than the prior setbacks that we've faced? I would say, yes, it is different. But each time has been different. And so this time, I think the positive this time is that consumers have money to spend. They are spending on automobiles and they're spending on health care and they're spending on home improvement and they're spending on all those things. I actually thought that they would spend less on those items in 2017, believing that they have been spending in those same categories in '16. But that is not what happened. They continue to spend in those same categories in '17 -- I'm sorry, in '16 as they did in '15. And so at some point in time, you've got to believe that everybody's going to have a brand-new car. At some point in time -- we've just had record after record performance of automobile sales. At some point in time, there's dollars that are going to be freed up for other categories of spending. And when they get to these categories, we have to be a major consideration. So one of the key strategies that we are working -- we are performing well in our exclusive and unique product. And as we've mentioned, the product brand sales are doing better than the market sales. The brands that we have from the market that are sold only at Macy's, brands like Tommy Hilfiger as an example, are selling significantly better than the more broadly distributed brands. And so we have to work that out with our vendor partners because supply and demand has become a real issue here and an opportunity for those who are working with us.",-2,1,-2

We make 50% to 55% EBITDA of revenue in Singapore with a much lower -- with a tax rate averaging about 15%. We get below that, which I'm confident we will significantly, and we have certain things to achieve there to get below that, then we don't need anywhere near as much money and, by any measure win [indiscernible] day by the tables or slots.

So what we're transitioning to now is more of the single name credit by credit aggressive disposition strategy.

And I recognize our consolidated operations in China are complicated because we have the Lincoln-imported products, some of the Ford-imported products. We also have the cost structure of Ford-owned entities and employees in China. And then we have our allocations that from the corporation and from engineering, et cetera, are in the consolidated numbers. So it's a compilation of a lot of things. Suffice to say, we don't believe in exporting vehicles at a contribution margin loss as long as we don't have a spike of import duties that are a near-term issue.
The solution to this largely is around localization plans for our business in China. We've been very public about we have 5 more vehicles being planned to be locally assembled in the near term. That includes the Lincoln, Corsair and the Ford Explorer. So we have a number of products that are going to be localized over the next year, 1.5 years, which will really influence this and will help us be more competitive cost-wise in the business in China but also will take away some of the exposure we've had to some of the fluctuations in tariff, so we feel good about that plan.
As you know and you noted, the Lincoln plan has been an import plan until now when we started localizing Lincoln Corsair and then more to come from there, which will really help with this. So they're contribution margin positive. There's a lot of costs in that consolidated business, but this will largely get taken care of by the localization plans we have going forward.",-2,1,1

655,790568,50601618,1248768,27862,eBay Inc.,"Yes, I mean, the first party -- we're not going to breakout Korea first party. It's not, in the greater scheme of things, a massive contributor on dollars. On a year-over-year basis, it's been growing nicely and does impact gross margins and that's why we've called it out. With respect to margins, a couple of things. As I called out, foreign exchange was 180 basis points of the -- was 80 basis points of the 180 versus prior year decline in margins. The rest of the decline was really driven by investments in and the integration of Ticketbis. And so at a broad level, if you want to call that unusual, that's a year-over-year change that's driving most of it. But similar to the last couple of years, we've offset many of the investments that we've been making to accelerate growth via leverage/productivity. And so I feel like, as we look at the first half of the year, there's always unusuals. We've called out Ticketbis in this case. But the fact of the matter is, I think, we've done a reasonably good job of operationally trading off the investments with productivity, recognizing that we do have that Ticketbis acquisition and foreign exchange. Maybe a bit more dynamic -- and get to your other question about foreign exchange, if you look at the last 2 years, those dynamics aren't that dissimilar with the ad that I would put in here, which is we had a standup cost in the first year of separation. And so again, a little bit of an unusual as we stood the company up as a standalone entity. As we look at year-to-year, we're able to offset much of the foreign exchange impact, the gains that were recorded historically below line and now that will be in revenue, as I called out in my remarks. But over time, a stronger U.S. dollar will pressure our margin rate and over time a weaker will help. But it's going to be muted on both sides, if not eliminated, with our hedging programs.",1,-2,-2
668,1435277,78568760,2007127,18671,Albemarle Corporation,"Yes. So we entered the year, as you know, with our capacity fully committed and under contract, 90% plus of our battery-grade materials are under contract. And as we go through this year, we obviously have the uncertainty associated with what might happen in the second half. But our intent is to keep our plants running, to keep our customers supplied. We are seeing some indications that they -- from a few customers that they're going to want to reduce their forecast. Those will be commercial discussions we have with them. 
There are other opportunities we have to place that volume if we have to, but our intent is to -- and our hope is our customers want our contracts. So at the moment, we don't -- we're operating on a place-the-volume-per-plan mode. There are -- or is a playbook we have that in the event there is a worst-case sort of recession coming, there certainly is a playbook we have around what we need to do, around how we'd run our plants. But we do not have any -- well, beyond what we've already announced, have further intent to close any plants at this point in time until we see how the second half demand plays out. I think that was your first question.
Second question was inventory, correct, Kendall? So inventory has been drawn down to some extent with customers we serve. We know that because they've reduced their volumes in the first half as expected. The challenge we have is not knowing what's happening else -- of course, China had a very weak first quarter itself because of the pandemic. Now automotive plants in Europe and the U.S. have been -- are closing, which, as I said earlier, could have a third quarter impact. And there's been numerous supply disruptions amongst our competitors, some of which is related to COVID-19 and some of which, frankly, has been related to their own liquidity challenges. 
So when you put all that together, it's very hard for me to comment on what inventory looks like and how much it has been drawn down across the channel -- across the whole industry. So I'll just have to sort of let you know as we go through. Maybe next quarter or 2, we'll get better clarity on that. But right now, it's quite muddy.",-3,0,-3

And as you stated, we don't think that this work will necessarily ever be done. It doesn't have an endpoint. It's one of those things, like security or privacy, where your comps have to evolve and comps have to stay 10 steps ahead as you learn the dynamics of the network and get better and better. We've made some really meaningful progress and definitely moving faster than our expectations, but there's still a lot ahead. We made a major shift this year in shifting more of our model and our enforcement towards behavior and conduct on the network rather than content. That is entirely machine learning and deep learning driven. And that should give us an ability to move much, much faster at scale. We're starting to really get a discipline around integrating this into how we think about all of our work. So as we thought about building the events experience and deploying it to the World Cup, health was a big factor of this. So it's becoming more and more of our DNA and something that the teams are asking the right questions to start any particular project. So as that develops over time, I do believe that we can move in a much more rapid pace. And we're doing a bunch of moves right now that are more coarse-grained to address and acknowledge a bunch of the things that we've seen for quite some time but weren't able to fully meet. But then it will be steady state, and we'll continue to push that work as fast as possible. But I am seeing a really good discipline, and the pace of innovation continues to rise.",2,-1,2

I think the industry was down about 2%, and we were down 2.1%, which could support your question about, is underlying demand flowing. But based on what we're hearing from the field, with the exception of energy, we're still confident that there is continued underlying demand growth. Some markets are stronger than others. And -- so we're still confident in the outlook.",2,-1,-1

I would just echo Pat's comments about the investments we made in Lean Six Sigma and some of our operating processes. The truck build in North America, Class 8 truck build, is expected to decline a little bit starting in 2020. That decline is not anticipated to be extremely dramatic, and there's no reason to believe that construction equipment build will vary dramatically as well. Having said that, to Pat's point, when our business contracts, if it does because of the cyclicality, I think we have a demonstrated ability to react appropriately. I do not believe, absent some very serious cyclical decline, that we would strip out fixed expenses. So said another way, [ Mike ], I believe that with reasonable reductions in revenues, we would expect to stay within that 20% to 25% band.",-2,1,-2
762,79752,10358935,164880,278143,HEICO Corporation,"Yes, I think we've got a lot of great products out there. We've got a fleet which continues to age. I mean, there invariably are going to be bumps in the road. There are times the airlines put out more aircraft and pull some aircraft off. But we're very bullish on the overall direction of this. We think the tide, the sea level is going to continue to increase. I mean, the tide will go up and down accordingly. But overall, I think we're going to do pretty well there. Our guidance is a little bit more conservative for the back half of the year, given the economic -- the worldwide economic situation today. We have not, thus far, seen any changes from our airline customers in terms of utilization or maintenance plans that would affect us.

I would've said to you that sequestration is going to be here. We're going to a have $408 billion base defense budget, we're going to get a budget on October 1 of '13 for Federal fiscal 2014 and then we're going -- it's going to give us some predictability. Then we went through September 30 and October 1 with the shutdown, a CRA that only goes through January 15 and a federal ceiling limit through February 7. I don't know right now. I just don't know what's going to happen and our customers don't know what's going to happen. They're very cautious. That's the tone, cautious, right now. If they've got $100 to spend or obligate, they're spending or obligating $70 and they're holding $30 in their pocket to see what's going to happen. And that's kind of what we see right now. So right now, Mark, if I had to speculate, I think '14 is going to be choppy on the DoD side, that's 60%, 65% of our business. We're on some great platforms, so our choppiness is banded. There's a band around it, which is very reassuring to us. And that's one of the reasons I went through a lot of those programs today. I wanted to reiterate to people that the programs we're on are fundamental to the national security of the United States. We're not going to be de-orbiting satellites. We're not going to be decommissioning Trident, ballistic missile submarines, thing with product operates etc. within the band is going to move around a little bit, but it's funded, it's going to be solid. And when we get clear of this environment, whenever that this, we're going to be really, really well-positioned. And thank -- I thank the Lord literally every day that 35% of our business is security -- is commercial security customer-focused or international-focused, especially in the missile and the radar area because people are arming to the teeth right now.",-3,0,-2

We may have to -- I mean, here's what -- we clearly are continuing to lower our cost structure in Energy, and Q4 is going to be roughly $10 million lower than Q3 in terms of cost structure. So you annualize that, you're going to get $30 million out of it next year, 1, 2, and 3 as you go through. So there's work to be done there, but we're going to get to a point, and we are close to it now, where we feel we've done the right thing on lowering our costs. What we don't want to do is cut too deeply into muscle because ultimately, this business does turn. As we've always said, we think the turn in the market is post '16. That's been a consistent view, and it remains our view, but we have taken steps to lower the costs.",-2,1,-2

In fact, it was only down about 1 point of growth from Q3 compared to Q2. And if you back out Southern Europe, Europe in itself without Southern Europe, had the same growth rate, Q3 and Q2. So continued to see strength in market such as the U.K., Germany and France. So Southern Europe, you got countries such as Spain with 20% unemployment clearly have had some challenges there. So quarter-over-quarter, there was a little bit more softness in Southern Europe, but not a tremendous amount.",2,-1,1

The only thing I would add is, just kind of reiterate what Scott Barbour said earlier, I wouldn't use kind of the past recession as an indicator just because of the dramatic kind of downturn we saw with construction and the ability to perform in that. But just as we do outperform the market when the market grows, if there is downturn in the market, we would expect our sales to still perform better than the market, maybe just not go down as much. So I think Scott said before, there's a lot of areas that are experiencing strong growth where we have lower market share that we would focus our efforts on to mitigate some of that economic downturn.",-2,1,-2

I mean we are growing 2, 3, in some quarters 4x faster than the market is growing, depending on the corridors. We find that we were really good at this when we were little. Now that we're big and we can offer all these payout countries, you see that we've now got almost 400,000 locations to pay out. It just -- you get that network effect, and that makes it even more possible for you to get to accelerate the growth of this business. 
So this is really exciting. This is really the Big Kahuna 2. This is $690 billion worth of remittances here. So we're accelerating, I would say, and we've been doing quite well up to this point. So that's really good.

You know what the deal is, is a lot of people are just -- in Britain, which is about now, call it, 50%, 60% of our business in XE are sends that are originated in Britain. Everybody is being really pensive now. Nobody knows exactly where the pound is going to go. They're being conservative. We're just seeing less transactions. It's not just with us because if you want to look at the results of our competitors, you'll see a very similar thing. So I think all this is going to get put to bed on Halloween, then we'll know from that point forward how it goes. I think it's just the uncertainty that's causing people to pause.",2,-1,-2
